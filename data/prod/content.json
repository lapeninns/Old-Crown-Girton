The largest thatched pub in the country feels properly historic, staff are warm, and portions are generous. Kids run off energy in the expansive garden and terrace while we relax. The Nepalese specials are full of flavor, and roasts are spot on. Free pub parking behind the building makes it easy for multi-generational meetups.", "rating": 5 },
