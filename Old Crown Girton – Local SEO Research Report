Old Crown Girton – Local SEO Research Report
1. Local Market & Competitor Analysis
Overview: The Old Crown in Girton operates in a small but competitive local market. Within a 3–5 mile radius are several pubs and eateries that vie for both village patrons and nearby Cambridge trade. Direct competitors include two other pubs in Girton itself (The George and The Travellers Rest) and numerous village pubs in neighboring areas (Histon, Coton, Madingley, Oakington), as well as restaurants and cafes in North Cambridge. Indirect competitors range from family restaurants and coffee shops to entertainment venues drawing locals out of Girton.
•	Top Local Pubs/Restaurants: In Girton, The George (71 High St) is a key competitor – a community-focused pub/cafe known as “Girton’s local hub for beers, fun and traditional pub grub”[1]. Also on Girton’s outskirts is The Travellers Rest (Beefeater chain), offering affordable grill meals to families and hotel guests. Nearby villages host popular gastropubs like The Boot in Histon (an award-winning cozy pub with seasonal menus)[2], The Red Lion in Histon (historic ale pub and B&B, CAMRA Pub of the Year)[3], The Plough in Coton (rustic-smart pub with an AA rosette and large garden)[4], and The Three Horseshoes in Madingley (a fine-dining thatched inn with 2 AA rosettes[5]). These, along with Cambridge city establishments, make up the top 10 or so venues influencing local diners.
•	Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): Competitors differentiate themselves through atmosphere, cuisine, and events. For example, The George emphasizes its community vibe and all-day use, opening as a café for students/professionals by morning and a friendly locals’ pub by evening[1][6]. The Boot in Histon positions as a gastropub destination – dog-friendly with a boules garden and “fresh, seasonal food” plus curated wines and cocktails[2]. The Red Lion highlights its real ale heritage and community sports teams (darts, pétanque, etc.) alongside offering rooms and an annual beer festival[3]. The Plough in Coton markets a high-end dining experience (Top 50 Gastropubs winner) with family-friendly touches like a play area and private event space[7][8]. Notably, none offer Nepalese cuisine, making the Old Crown’s menu a unique niche in the area.
•	Local Search Rankings: For hyper-local queries like “pub near me Girton,” the closest pubs (Old Crown, The George, and nearby village pubs) appear prominently on Google Maps given proximity and strong reviews. The Old Crown and The George likely feature at the top of Girton-specific results due to their location and Google ratings (Old Crown is rated ~4.6/5 and ranked #1 of Girton restaurants on TripAdvisor[9]). In contrast, broader searches such as “best restaurant Cambridge” surface city-center venues (e.g. Michelin-starred Midsummer House, popular bistros), which are outside Girton. This indicates that the Old Crown’s SEO focus should be on local intents (Girton/North Cambridge queries) rather than trying to compete directly with central Cambridge fine dining. However, in lists of “best pubs in Cambridge area,” places like The Plough or The Boot often get mentions due to awards, so carving out a distinctive reputation (e.g. “best Nepalese pub restaurant in Cambridge”) can help Old Crown rank for unique comparisons.
•	Customer Review Sentiments: Reviews of local establishments reveal what customers value. Common praise for pubs in the area includes friendly staff and atmosphere, quality of food (e.g. “lovely food”, “fabulous Sunday roast”[10]), and family-friendliness. The Old Crown’s own reviews frequently mention its welcoming service and flavorful Nepalese dishes, confirming these as strengths. By contrast, any recurring complaints (for Old Crown or competitors) tend to be about slow service during peak times or price vs. value perceptions – these are opportunities to outperform competitors by ensuring efficient service and solid value. Overall, customers laud the local pubs for their community feel and good food, and the Old Crown’s high ratings show it meets these expectations well (and even exceeds them with its unique cuisine).
•	Competitor Promotions & Events: Local competitors leverage events and seasonal themes to attract patrons. Weekly pub quizzes are a staple at several pubs (e.g. The Boot’s Tuesday Quiz Night[11], Red Lion’s quiz and music nights). Live music and beer festivals are also common: The George hosts an annual Girton Beer Festival each June with live music and local brews[12], and the Red Lion runs a popular beer festival and sports big-screen events (e.g. showing football or rugby matches). Many pubs push special food nights (The Boot’s Steak Night, The Plough’s renowned Sunday roast[8][13]) and holiday events (Christmas menus, Halloween parties). Monitoring these can spark ideas for the Old Crown: for example, offering its own quiz night or a cultural event (a Nepalese food festival or tasting night) would differentiate it while still tapping into what locals enjoy. In summary, the local market is active with community events and seasonal promotions – to stay competitive, the Old Crown should participate in or create such events, emphasizing those that highlight its Nepalese-British fusion and welcoming atmosphere.
2. Local Keywords & Search Behavior
Geo-Targeted Keywords: To capture local search traffic, content must include geographic modifiers relevant to Girton and Cambridge. Examples of high-value location keywords include “Girton pub”, “pub in Girton Cambridge”, “Old Crown Girton” (brand-specific), “north Cambridge restaurants”, and “Girton High Street dining”. Broader area terms like “Cambridge pub”, “Cambridge gastropub near University”, and neighborhood-based searches (e.g. “pub near Girton College”, “pub near Eddington”) can also draw in users willing to travel a few miles. Additionally, the Old Crown should leverage its unique identity with keywords like “Nepalese restaurant Cambridge” or “Nepalese food Girton/Cambridge”, since this niche has low competition in the region yet high intent from those specifically seeking that cuisine. For tourism appeal, terms such as “historic Cambridge pub” or “traditional English pub Cambridge” align with the Old Crown’s thatched-roof charm.
Search Volume Insights: While exact monthly volumes require keyword tools, we can infer relative demand. Broad terms like “Cambridge restaurants” or “Cambridge pubs” receive thousands of searches a month, whereas hyper-local terms (“Girton pub”, “restaurants in Girton”) are likely in the low hundreds or dozens per month – but these are highly targeted queries that the Old Crown can dominate. Branded searches for “Old Crown Girton” will correspond to the pub’s local popularity and marketing; as visibility grows, expect those to increase. Long-tail phrases often indicate strong intent despite lower volume. For instance, “Sunday roast near Girton” or “best Sunday roast Cambridge” might not be searched by the thousands, but anyone querying it is actively looking to dine out for Sunday lunch. The Old Crown’s content can capture these by featuring its Sunday roast offerings (if any) and including those phrases on the site. Similarly, phrases like “family friendly pub Cambridge”, “dog-friendly pub near Cambridge”, or “beer garden Cambridge” have moderate searches and lower competition – optimizing for these (through blog posts or GMB attributes) could yield highly convertible traffic (families and pet owners searching specifically for a place like Old Crown).
High-Intent Long-Tails: Long-tail keywords in the local context often correspond to question-style searches or very specific needs. Examples include: “Where is the best pub in Girton?”, “What’s the menu at Old Crown Girton?”, “pubs near me with live music”, or “closest pub serving Nepalese food”. Many people also use “near me” queries without typing a location – e.g. “pubs near me open now” – letting their phone/GPS supply the context. Ensuring the Old Crown’s Google My Business listing is up-to-date (hours, “open now” flag, etc.) will capture those spontaneous near-me searches when the user is in range. Another tactic is to include an FAQ section on the website covering common questions (e.g. “Do we need to book a table at Old Crown Girton?”, “Does Old Crown have parking?”, “Is Old Crown pub kid-friendly?”). Not only does this directly answer likely queries, it can help the site appear in voice search results and Google’s “People also ask” boxes.
“Near Me” and Mobile Searches: It’s important to note the majority of local searches happen on mobile devices with immediate intent – roughly 76% of people who search for something nearby on their smartphone visit a related business within a day[14]. Phrases like “near me,” “closest,” or “open now” (e.g. “pub open now near Girton”) have surged in usage. The Old Crown should target these by combining strong local SEO (so it appears in the Google Maps 3-pack) and timely information (so that queries like “open now” surface its listing when applicable). A focus on intent keywords is also key: terms indicating intent to dine or drink, such as “book table Girton pub”, “takeaway Girton” (for its takeaway service), “pub lunch Cambridge”, or “pint after work Cambridge north”, signal users ready to act. These might have lower volume, but content and ads targeting them can yield high conversion.
Popular Questions: Monitoring forums and search suggestions reveals common questions locals and visitors ask. For Cambridge pubs, questions like “What is the oldest pub in Cambridge?”, “Which Cambridge pubs have parking?”, or “Are pubs open on Sunday in Cambridge?” often appear. In Girton’s context, people might ask “Is there a pub in Girton village?” (especially new residents or Girton College students), or “What’s the best restaurant in Girton?”. Ensuring that the Old Crown is the clear answer (through SEO and content) to “best pub in Girton” or “where to eat in Girton” will capture that inquisitive traffic. Also, leveraging University-related queries – for example, “pub near Girton College” or “student-friendly pubs Cambridge” – could pull in academic patrons.
In summary, a two-pronged keyword strategy is needed: (1) dominate hyper-local Girton searches (where competition is minimal and Old Crown can rank #1 for most terms), and (2) compete for North/Cambridge-wide terms that match its niche (such as Nepalese cuisine, family-friendly pub, Sunday roast, etc.). By doing comprehensive keyword research with tools and aligning site content to these phrases, the Old Crown can significantly boost its local search visibility. Every piece of content (page or post) should be optimized around a cluster of these local keywords to capture both the broad and specific searches that local customers use.
3. Local Community & Culture
 
The Old Crown pub in Girton is known for its distinctive thatched roof (claimed to be the largest thatched pub in the country[15]), reflecting the village’s historic charm. Embracing local heritage and community is crucial to its identity.
Community Profile: Girton is a sizable village of about 4,500 residents, located just 2 miles northwest of Cambridge city[16]. It has a mix of long-term villagers, families, and a notable academic presence due to Girton College (a constituent college of the University of Cambridge located in the village). Demographically, the community includes many families and middle-to-upper income households (Girton is a desirable suburb for Cambridge commuters), as well as students and university staff who reside at or near the college. This blend means local businesses like the Old Crown must cater to both traditional village tastes and more cosmopolitan expectations from university affiliates.
Local Institutions & Influences: The University connection is significant – Girton College was historically the first women’s college in Cambridge and remains a thriving academic community. Its students and staff contribute to the weekday population in term time, potentially frequenting local shops and pubs. Beyond the college, Girton has a primary school (Girton Glebe), a parish church (St. Andrew’s), and active clubs (sports teams, a village social club, etc.), all of which foster a close-knit feel. Local transportation is convenient: a regular bus route (Stagecoach Citi 6) links Girton to Cambridge, and many residents cycle into town. The pub benefits from being on a main route (High Street just off Huntingdon Rd/A14), with ample parking and bike accessibility (there is free pub parking behind the building[17] and a cycle path nearby). This ease of access draws not only villagers but also people from surrounding areas who prefer to avoid city traffic.
What Makes Girton Unique: Despite its proximity to Cambridge, Girton has retained a village identity. There’s a strong sense of community pride – evidenced by things like the Girton village sign and annual traditions. The presence of the thatched-roof Old Crown and other historic structures gives Girton a quaint, traditional English character, yet the influx of students and faculty adds a progressive, international flavor. The Old Crown can capitalize on this dynamic by positioning itself as “Girton’s meeting place” where all segments of the community intersect: longtime residents swap stories in the bar, parents bring kids for Sunday lunch, and college students celebrate end-of-term in the beer garden. Engaging with key community figures (the parish council, college officials, school head, etc.) and participating in village life will strengthen the pub’s local roots.
Community Events & Traditions: Girton hosts several events throughout the year that present opportunities for the Old Crown. The biggest is Girton Feast Week, a community festival each summer (usually July) that includes a village fête, live music, and a beer festival on the recreation ground[18][19]. For example, in 2024 the Feast featured tribute concerts and a beer tent; the Old Crown could sponsor or supply beers for such events, gaining visibility. There are also seasonal fairs (Christmas markets, church bazaars) and charity events run by local clubs. Girton Feast’s beer festival is a natural fit – the pub could collaborate or host pre/post events. Moreover, Girton College has its own calendar (e.g. Freshers’ Week in October, May Week garden parties in June, lecture series, etc.) – finding ways to tie in (such as offering student discounts during Freshers, or hosting a special menu during graduation week when families visit) can capture that audience.
Local History & Heritage: Incorporating Girton’s history can endear the pub to locals. The village has a rich history dating back to Roman times[20], and the Old Crown itself has been around (in one form or another) since the 19th century. In fact, the current pub building was constructed in the 1930s to replace an older inn, and apart from interior refurbishments, it remains largely the same structure[15]. Embracing this heritage (perhaps via a display of old photos or a section on the website about the pub’s story) turns the Old Crown into more than just a restaurant – it’s “part of Girton’s history.” Girton villagers appreciate this continuity; several generations have used the Old Crown as a social hub. Storytelling about the pub (like notable past landlords, or the fact that it used to be famed for huge portion sizes in decades past[21]) can be charming content that resonates locally.
University Proximity Impact: Being near Cambridge University (especially Girton College) means the pub can attract an intellectual and international crowd not typical of every village pub. During term time, one might find a mix of professors and students among the patrons. This raises opportunities such as hosting academic society gatherings (quiz nights themed on academic trivia, perhaps) or simply ensuring the menu has some globally appealing options (which, with Nepalese cuisine, it certainly does). The college also brings in visitors – prospective students, alumni, conference attendees – who may look for dining options nearby. A presence on college notice boards or welcome packets (if permissible) could funnel some of that traffic. Additionally, being known as a student-friendly pub (with affordable bites, Wi-Fi, maybe even a study-friendly afternoon atmosphere on weekdays) could differentiate Old Crown from competitors that cater mostly to families or older locals.
Cultural and Seasonal Patterns: Girton’s rhythm changes with the academic calendar and seasons. During University vacations (especially summer and Christmas), student numbers drop, and the pub might rely more on local families and tourists. In summer, many families travel, but conversely tourists and day-trippers increase – some might pass through Girton for the nearby Cambridge American Cemetery or en route to destinations via M11/A14. The pub can attract these visitors by highlighting itself as an “authentic village pub minutes from the city” – offering a calm alternative to busy city centre pubs. In term time, weeknight business might pick up from college folks (e.g. after formal hall or sports matches). Winter months see locals seeking cozy indoor venues – the Old Crown’s fireplaces and warm interior become a selling point for villagers and Cambridge folk willing to drive out for a snug evening. On the other hand, summer months with long evenings make the garden terrace a big asset (Girton’s west-facing sunsets are lovely, as noted in reviews). Marketing should adjust to these patterns: e.g. promoting the heated fires and hearty ales in winter, versus BBQs and Pimm’s in the garden during summer.
Community Integration: Finally, understanding who the local influencers are can help. Girton likely has active Facebook community groups and perhaps a village newsletter or magazine. Getting mentions or advertising in those (for instance, writing a piece for the Girton Parish News about the pub’s new offerings) will reach deeply into the community. Forming partnerships – like providing vouchers or prizes for school fundraisers, hosting a charity quiz for the church, or supplying snacks for a Girton Colts (youth football) game – all build goodwill. Girton’s residents will strongly support a business that visibly supports them. The goal is for The Old Crown to be viewed not just as a place to eat, but as an integral part of Girton life – where memories are made during village milestones (birthdays, post-fête celebrations, etc.). By aligning with Girton’s unique blend of tradition and academia, the Old Crown can firmly establish itself as “Girton’s own pub” in the hearts of locals.
4. Customer Persona Research
The Old Crown serves a diverse clientele. We’ve identified five primary target audiences, each with distinct motivations and needs. Below, we profile each persona and how the pub can appeal to them:
•	Local Families (Parents with Children): This group values a family-friendly dining experience. They typically seek out the Old Crown for weekend lunches (especially the classic Sunday roast) or early evening dinners. Key preferences include a varied kids’ menu (with smaller portions or mild spice options given the Nepalese cuisine), availability of high chairs, and a relaxed atmosphere where children are welcome. Price sensitivity is moderate – parents are willing to spend for quality time out, but appreciate kids-eat-free deals or bundle offers. Many local families are active on Facebook community groups and look for recommendations there; they’re also likely to leave positive Facebook/Google reviews when pleased. To win them over, the Old Crown should emphasize its “family pub” attributes: e.g. a play area or garden space for kids to burn off energy, board games or coloring sheets available at tables, and perhaps hosting family events (like an Easter egg hunt or Mother’s Day special menu). Influences on their choice include word-of-mouth from other parents, safety/cleanliness, and whether the menu can accommodate picky eaters. By positioning itself as a safe, welcoming spot for local families (e.g. “children welcome until 9pm,” baby-changing facilities, and friendly staff that engage kids), the pub can become a go-to for parents in Girton.
•	University Students & Staff: This persona includes Girton College students (mostly ages 18–25) as well as young researchers or faculty living in the area. Students often look for affordable, social venues – a pub to unwind with friends, celebrate after exams, or even study during off-peak hours. They are drawn by features like free Wi-Fi, casual seating areas, and events like pub quizzes, karaoke, or student discount nights. Price is a factor (student budgets), so promotions such as weeknight beer discounts, loyalty cards, or a cheap “student special” meal can be effective. They typically visit later in the evenings or for Friday/Saturday outings, though some may come for an occasional weekday lunch or brunch. Social media-wise, students are more on Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter; a strong Instagram showing delicious food or a fun pub vibe can catch their interest. University staff (lecturers, admin) are slightly older (mid-20s to 50s) and might use the pub for informal work lunches or after-work pints. They value a conversation-friendly environment (not too loud) and good food quality for the price. Influences for this group include peer recommendations and convenience – e.g. a Girton student with no car is likely to patronize the nearby Old Crown rather than going into city, provided it meets their needs. By catering to them with things like a quiz night timed for college students, or broadcasting major sports (Six Nations rugby, football Champions League) on big screens, the Old Crown becomes the student hangout in Girton. For university staff, perhaps a “Cambridge staff discount” or hosting departmental socials could pull them in. Ultimately, being known as “student-friendly (but not student-only)” will help fill seats on weeknights and cultivate loyalty among the academic crowd.
•	Village Residents (Long-Term Locals): These are Girtonians who have lived in the village for many years (including middle-aged and retired residents). For them, the pub is a community living room – a place to chat with neighbors, enjoy a regular pint or cup of tea, and feel part of village life. They typically visit on weekday evenings (especially quiz nights or just their traditional “pint on a Friday”) and Sunday afternoons. Their dining preferences lean toward traditional pub fare and consistency: while some are adventurous, many will appreciate that Old Crown still offers familiar British dishes (fish and chips, pies, roast dinners) alongside Nepalese options. Price-wise, many are comfortable with standard pub prices, but offering value (quality ingredients, good portions) is key to keeping their loyalty. This group may not be very active on social media; they gather info from village notice boards, the parish newsletter, or by chatting with friends. To reach them, offline engagement is important – e.g. putting event flyers up at the village store or community center, or simply ensuring staff personally invite them to upcoming events. What influences their choice most is the atmosphere and personal touch: they want to feel recognized and welcomed by staff who know their name or usual order. Cleanliness, comfort (warm in winter, ample seating), and perhaps nostalgia (any ties the pub has to old Girton) also matter. To meet their needs, the Old Crown should maintain a cosy, friendly ambiance – think comfortable chairs, maybe a real fireplace (which it has) lit in cooler months, and friendly conversation. If the pub can host local interest events (like a talk on Girton history or a charity bake sale) or accommodate community groups (book club, knitting circle meetups), it will deepen its bond with village stalwarts. In essence, reliability and community spirit are the hooks for long-term residents.
•	Cambridge Visitors & Tourists: Tourists or visitors to Cambridge who venture slightly off the beaten path are another persona. They might be domestic travelers exploring beyond the city center, or international tourists brought by curiosity or on someone’s recommendation (e.g. TripAdvisor users who see Old Crown ranked highly). Additionally, this includes guests staying at nearby hotels (the Holiday Inn Impington, Travelodge Orchard Park, or B&Bs in north Cambridge) who are looking for a good local meal. These visitors typically look for an “authentic English pub experience.” They are attracted by things like a historic building, local ales, and traditional dishes – but in the Old Crown’s case, they also get intrigued by the unique Nepalese menu (often mentioned in reviews as a positive surprise). They usually visit at lunchtime or dinner time while sightseeing. Price sensitivity varies – many are willing to spend a bit more on vacation for a quality experience, but they expect clear pricing and value. This persona checks online reviews extensively; a high TripAdvisor rating (currently 4.6/5) and positive Google reviews strongly influence them. They might only find the pub if it’s well-promoted on travel sites or recommended by locals, since Girton is outside the tourist center. Thus, ensuring the Old Crown is listed or featured in “Where to eat in Cambridge” articles or on tourism maps can help. Once they arrive, they need easy parking and directions, and they appreciate when staff can give a brief background (“This pub is a local favorite, we serve a fusion of British and Nepalese cuisine – quite unique!”). Their needs include taking photos (the thatched roof and plated dishes are Instagrammable), possibly dietary accommodations (tourists often ask about vegetarian or gluten-free options), and a desire for local flavor – both literally in terms of local beers and culturally in interacting with friendly staff/patrons. The Old Crown can appeal to them by highlighting its heritage and uniqueness – for example, a little printed blurb on the table about the pub’s history or menu origin makes their visit feel special. Providing excellent service is crucial, because tourists will amplify their experience in reviews. A satisfied visitor might write about the “charming village pub just outside Cambridge” which in turn draws more. In summary, for visitors, the Old Crown should deliver a memorable, story-worthy experience that complements their Cambridge journey (and maybe gets them to leave a 5-star review afterwards).
•	Business Professionals (Cambridge Workers and Corporate Guests): This persona covers people working in and around Cambridge – from those at the Science Park or West Cambridge sites, to professionals visiting offices in the area or staying at nearby business hotels. They are looking either for a quick, quality lunch on weekdays or a relaxed venue for after-work drinks and dinners. During lunchtime, time is of the essence: they favor pubs that can serve a good meal within an hour. A weekday lunch menu (perhaps a prix fixe deal or lighter options) would attract them. After work (weekday evenings), they might come in small groups for a de-stress pint or to entertain a client in a less formal setting than downtown. This group values convenience and consistency – ample parking, the ability to reserve a table for a group, and knowing that they can hear each other talk (so background music should be not too loud, for instance). Many in this segment use platforms like Google Maps or Yelp to find “restaurants near [location]” or rely on colleagues’ recommendations. They might also see the pub’s posts on LinkedIn if the business is active there (though for a pub, LinkedIn isn’t primary, but joining local business networks could help). Influencers here might be corporate administrators (choosing a venue for team dinners) or hotel concierges (recommending local dining). Price-wise, professionals aren’t as price-sensitive individually, but if it’s a working lunch they’ll expect reasonable prices and perhaps itemized bills. The Old Crown can appeal to them by marketing its accessibility and quality: e.g. “Beat the city traffic – meet at Old Crown in Girton for your business lunch; just 5 minutes from Science Park, with free parking.” Offering services like online reservation (already on the website) and maybe a private area for meetings (if one of the dining sections can be semi-private) can make the pub a preferred spot for offsite meetings or small corporate gatherings. Ensuring reliable Wi-Fi and even having some sockets for laptop users could turn the lunch trade into working lunches. They also appreciate when service is professional – this means staff being attentive to timing (asking if they’re on a lunch hour to expedite things) and providing receipts promptly. By balancing the casual pub charm with a bit of business-friendly polish, the Old Crown can attract professionals who might otherwise default to chain restaurants. Once they have a good experience, these patrons often become repeat customers weekly, and may bring larger groups (team dinners, etc.) in the future.
Summary of Personas: To maximize appeal, the Old Crown should tailor its offerings and marketing messaging to these groups. For example, a monthly event calendar might include a Kids’ Day or family Sunday, a student quiz night, a retirees’ coffee morning discount, and a networking happy hour – covering the spectrum. On digital channels, content should speak sometimes to parents (Facebook: “Looking for a no-fuss family dinner? Kids eat free Mondays 5–7!”), sometimes to students (Instagram: “🕺 Friday Night = Student Night, 10% off with student ID”), etc. By addressing each persona’s unique drivers – be it price, atmosphere, or convenience – The Old Crown can increase footfall and ensure each visitor feels the pub is “made for them.” This personalized approach builds loyalty among diverse customer types and sustains business across different times of day and seasons.
5. Seasonal & Event-Based Opportunities
Seasonality plays a significant role in the hospitality business, and the Old Crown can greatly benefit from planning around annual events, holidays, and seasonal trends. Below we outline key time-based opportunities and how the pub might leverage them:
University Calendar Events: Being near Cambridge University means the Old Crown should note the academic cycle: - Freshers’ Week (early October): As new Girton College students arrive, it’s a chance to introduce them to the pub. Hosting a “Welcome Students” night or offering a special during this week (e.g. a student ID discount or a mixer event) can establish early patronage. - Term Time Socials: Throughout Michaelmas (Oct–Dec), Lent (Jan–Mar), and Easter (Apr–Jun) terms, consider aligning events with student life. For example, mid-term “de-stress” evenings (perhaps a game night near exam time in November or February) or celebratory offers after exams in late November/March. Also, May Week (early June), when exams finish and celebrations happen, is an opportunity – Girton students will be in high spirits; the pub could throw a post-exam BBQ or “May Week Curry Feast” to attract them. - Graduation & Alumni: Late June/early July sees graduations and alumni reunions. Many families visit Cambridge. The Old Crown can market itself as a great spot for a graduation family meal away from the crowds (perhaps a fixed menu for grad parties) and even decorate congrats banners for local grads. For alumni events at Girton College (often in September), having a presence or invitation (“Alumni, come revisit your old haunt at the Old Crown!”) could bring people in.
Local Community Events: - Girton Feast Week (July): This is the village’s marquee event, typically spanning several days of activities and culminating in a big weekend fête and beer festival[22][19]. The Old Crown should plan well ahead for Feast Week. Ideas: sponsor a stall or game at the fête (show community support), brew a special ale or create a “Feast Week Cocktail” for that week, and certainly advertise extended hours or live music at the pub to catch attendees before or after the official events. If there’s a beer festival tent on the recreation ground, perhaps supply a unique cask of Nepalese-inspired ale or arrange cross-promotion (e.g. “Keep your festival glass – get it filled at Old Crown for £X”). - Village Sporting Events: Local sports clubs (cricket in summer, maybe village football in winter) often have finals or big matches. Hosting the team’s after-party or simply ensuring you show any big games (like if Girton has a cricket week) will draw supporters. Even offering to become a sponsor for a team (with pub name on jerseys) can strengthen ties. - Charity and Seasonal Fairs: Girton might have a Christmas lights switch-on or winter fair, a Harvest festival in autumn, etc. The pub can join in by offering seasonal treats – e.g. mince pies and mulled wine during the Christmas fair, or hosting a small Christmas craft market in its garden if space allows. At Halloween, if the village has trick-or-treat traditions, consider a pumpkin carving contest or a kids’ Halloween party in the pub (earlier in evening) followed by an adults’ costume night later.
Sports & National Events: Pubs are natural gathering spots for sports fans and national celebrations: - Football & Rugby: The pub now advertises “watch all the big games” on large screens[23], which is fantastic. Major tournaments to capitalize on: Premier League and FA Cup (important matches involving popular teams – e.g. advertise screenings of those), Six Nations Rugby (Feb–Mar each year; often a big draw on weekends – consider special breakfast for early matches or themed food like burgers for matches), The FIFA World Cup/Euro (when on, packs pubs – ensure promotions like “Burger + Pint during England game £X”). The Red Lion Histon explicitly promoted Six Nations bookings; Old Crown should too, given its screens. - Wimbledon Tennis (July): Perhaps set up a strawberries & cream offering or Pimm’s pitchers during Wimbledon matches on TV. - Olympics/Commonwealth Games: If any British interest events happen, could open earlier or have themed nights. - Major UK Celebrations: Events like Royal weddings, coronations, Jubilee celebrations – villages often come together. The pub can be a venue for a street party or viewing party. For instance, during the recent coronation, many pubs held special afternoon teas or showed it live. - Local Teams: Cambridge United (football) home games – fans traveling from the Girton side might stop for a pre- or post-game drink. If the schedule aligns, do a “match day” offer (wear a Cambridge scarf, get a discount, etc.). Same with any local rugby or cricket clubs finals.
Holiday Seasons: - Christmas & New Year: The festive season is huge for pubs. The Old Crown should have a Christmas menu (likely a set menu for office parties or family gatherings) ready by early November and marketed online and via flyers. Emphasize any unique offerings – maybe a Nepalese twist on Christmas dishes alongside the roast turkey. Hosting a Christmas carol evening with mince pies or a charity Christmas jumper contest could attract locals looking for holiday cheer. For New Year’s Eve, decide if it will host a special event (ticketed party with music, or a quieter dinner). If doing a NYE party, advertise early and maybe collaborate with local taxi companies for safe rides home (that could encourage more attendance). - Winter (Jan/Feb): This is a traditionally slow period after New Year. The pub can create events to lure people out of hibernation: e.g. a Burns Night supper in late January (tapping into any Scots in the community or those who enjoy whisky – could even fuse Nepalese and Scottish by doing a Gurkha-themed Burns Night since Nepalese Gurkhas served the British Empire, etc.), or Valentine’s Day dinner in February (set up a cozy romantic ambiance and special menu for couples – many people prefer a village pub for a low-key Valentine’s). - Spring (Mar–May): Key occasions: Mother’s Day and Father’s Day. These Sundays will be high demand for lunch – advertise a special menu and perhaps a small gift for moms/dads who dine (flowers for Mum, a free pint for Dad, etc.). Easter is another big one: Good Friday and Easter Sunday often bring families out – maybe an Easter Sunday buffet or an egg hunt in the garden to draw families. Spring is also when people start wanting to sit outside; ensure the garden is spruced up by April and consider a spring launch event (like a “Garden Opening Party” on the first warm weekend). - Summer (Jun–Aug): Aside from the village feast, the pub can hold its own summer events: a monthly BBQ night, outdoor live music on weekends (noise permits considered), or a quiz on the terrace. With longer daylight, perhaps even a weekend “beergarden brunch” offering – e.g. offer brunch menu on Saturdays in summer to attract cyclists or day-trippers passing through in the morning. Also, capitalize on bank holidays (May bank holidays, August bank holiday) by hosting something special – like a hog roast, a beer festival at the pub, or a family fun day with face painting and games. These can position the Old Crown as a summertime destination. Weather-wise, having contingency (gazebos for rain, parasols for heat) will be good for maximizing outdoor space use.
Menu Seasonality: Each season brings menu opportunities: - Autumn (Sep–Nov): Embrace hearty dishes and seasonal produce (squash, game, stews). Perhaps run an Oktoberfest week in late September with German beers and pretzels, or a special Curry Night when the weather cools (people love spicy warmth in autumn). Also, as daylight fades, an Autumn Ales festival showcasing local brews could be a hit. - Winter (Dec–Feb): Emphasize comfort foods – rich curries, mulled cider, etc. A New Year “healthy menu” option in January (like lighter Nepalese dishes or vegetarian specials) might attract those with resolutions, while still offering indulgences for those who are not dieting. - Spring (Mar–May): Introduce fresh spring vegetables into dishes, maybe an Easter lamb special. Spring also has events like Lent – maybe a “Fish on Fridays” special for those observing, or vegetarian specials. - Summer (Jun–Aug): Lighter fare and grill items. Perhaps add Nepali-inspired salads, use the grill for kebabs in the garden, and emphasize cold drinks (craft cider, summery cocktails). As mentioned, a Sunday BBQ or occasional pig roast can draw crowds in good weather.
Collaboration & Sponsorship: Look at local calendars for events the pub could sponsor or partner with: - The village primary school fete (sponsor the raffle in exchange for putting a banner up). - A charity run or cycling event passing through (set up a water station or offer participants a discount on meals). - Cambridge-wide events like the Cambridge Beer Festival (May) – if the pub can’t have a stall, maybe host a fringe event that week (e.g. “Beer Festival After-Party – continue sampling ales at Old Crown”). - Cambridge Festival (formerly Science Festival) in spring – lots of visitors in town; a quirky idea could be to have a “Science of Cocktails” night or just extended hours when those events are on, to lure attendees to dine outside city center.
Peak vs Lull Times: Identifying when the pub will be busiest vs quietest guides marketing focus: - Peak times likely include: Friday and Saturday evenings year-round; Sunday lunch year-round; any quiz or event night; the month of December (holiday parties); and sunny summer weekends. During peaks, the strategy is to maximize revenue – ensure menus are optimized (e.g. special sharers for big groups), staff up adequately to handle crowds (so reviews stay positive), and perhaps have premium offerings (a special cocktail or dessert) to upsell when footfall is high. - Lull times might be Monday–Wednesday in winter, mid-afternoons on weekdays, and post-holiday January. These are times to drive promotions: for instance, a “Curry and a Pint for £X” on a Tuesday, or a Wednesday night board game night to attract a niche group. In summer, mid-week might still be steady if tourists come, but a rainy day can cause an abrupt lull – having a “Rainy Day Deal” (announce on social “It’s pouring – cheer up with hot curry 20% off today only!”) could turn a slow day around.
By mapping out a seasonal marketing calendar, the Old Crown can stay ahead of the curve and ensure there’s always something happening. This maintains customer interest and loyalty (locals start looking forward to “Trivia Thursdays in winter” or “Summer BBQ Saturdays”). Importantly, many of these events and promotions also provide fresh content for the pub’s website and social media – which boosts SEO and engagement. In essence, leveraging seasonal and event-based opportunities will keep the Old Crown relevant and bustling throughout the year, turning external events and weather changes into strategic advantages rather than challenges.
6. Digital Presence & Reputation Research
In today’s digital-first world, a business’s online presence often forms customers’ first impressions. For the Old Crown Girton, maintaining a strong, positive digital profile is crucial for attracting new patrons and retaining existing ones. Below we analyze the pub’s current online reputation, social media presence, and digital opportunities:
Online Reviews & Reputation: The Old Crown enjoys a very favorable online reputation at present. On major platforms: - Google Reviews: (Hypothetical example) The pub might have a Google rating around 4.5★ with hundreds of reviews. Common themes in reviews include praise for the delicious Nepalese dishes, the friendly and attentive service, and the cozy atmosphere. For instance, one TripAdvisor reviewer noted it was “family friendly” and the “food [was] lovely”[24], while others rave about specific dishes (the momo or curries) and the pub’s warmth. Consistently high ratings have landed Old Crown as the #1 ranked restaurant in Girton on TripAdvisor[9] and a recommended spot on Google Maps for the area. This positive sentiment is a huge asset – prospective customers read these and are encouraged to visit. - Negative feedback: Though rare, it’s important to acknowledge any recurring negatives in reviews. A scan of feedback might reveal minor issues like slightly slow service on a busy night, confusion about the menu spice levels, or perhaps an ambiance note (e.g. “it was a bit noisy during the game on TV”). These should be addressed constructively: e.g. ensuring staff levels are adequate at peak times, clearly marking spicy dishes, and maybe zoning the pub so diners not interested in TV can sit in a quieter area. The management should respond to online reviews politely – thanking those who praise, and diplomatically addressing any complaints with a note of corrective action or invitation to return. Active management responses show prospective customers that the pub cares.
Social Media Presence: The Old Crown has an opportunity to significantly grow its social media engagement. Currently: - Facebook: The pub’s Facebook page is active with frequent posts about offers and events. For example, a recent post advertised “Buy 1, Get 1 FREE deals on draught beer & house wine” during happy hour[25] – a great tactic to draw after-work crowds. Locals often engage with these posts by tagging friends or commenting, which increases reach. Facebook is an ideal platform for reaching the local community (families and residents) since many are members of local groups. The Old Crown can boost engagement by sharing photo albums of events (e.g. pictures from a quiz night or Feast Week), using Facebook Events for upcoming happenings (so followers get reminders), and even running occasional contests (“Share this post for a chance to win a free dinner for two!”). - Instagram: Visual platforms like Instagram are key to attracting younger demographics (students, young professionals, tourists). The Old Crown’s Instagram (@theoldcrowngirton) shows enticing photos of menu items (e.g. a spicy duck broth special was highlighted[26]), interior shots, and customers enjoying themselves. This helps showcase the pub’s character. The pub should post consistently, using relevant hashtags (#CambridgeEats, #Girton, #PubLife, #NepaleseFood) to appear in searches. Stories can be used for real-time updates (like “Live music starting now!” or kitchen prep behind-the-scenes). Encouraging user-generated content is powerful – perhaps a small incentive for customers who tag the pub in their IG story or post (like featuring the best photo of the month on the pub’s page) can create buzz. - Twitter/X: The Old Crown has a presence (@girtonoldcrown) with occasional tweets, possibly auto-sharing from Instagram[27]. Twitter can be used to engage with Cambridge-wide conversations – e.g. replying to Cambridge food bloggers, announcing quiz winners, or participating in trending topics (“National Beer Day”, etc.). It likely won’t drive as much foot traffic as Facebook/Instagram, but it’s good for community interaction and SEO (tweets show up in Google sometimes). - Other Platforms: The pub should ensure it’s present and updated on other relevant sites: TripAdvisor (keep description and photos current – TripAdvisor is still heavily used by tourists and older demographics), Yelp (less popular in the UK, but as evidenced by Yelp listing top Girton pubs, being listed correctly helps), and local directories like Visit Cambridge or Cambridge Edition if possible. Also, Nextdoor app (for local neighborhoods) can be a place locals ask for pub recommendations – having some loyal customers mention Old Crown there can be organic marketing.
Content Performance: Analyzing what content works best: - On Facebook, posts that typically perform well for pubs include photos of food specials (people tag others saying “let’s try this!”), event announcements (especially if they involve the community, like charity nights or featuring local musicians), and human-interest snippets (introducing a team member or celebrating an achievement like “1 year since reopening – thank you Girton!”). Videos or live streams (a quick kitchen tour or live music clip) also up engagement. - On Instagram, high-quality images of menu items or the picturesque pub exterior (thatched roof against a sunset sky) get a lot of likes. Stories with polls (“Which new ale should we tap next? Vote now”) can get followers interacting. Themed series – such as a weekly “Curry Spotlight” featuring one Nepalese dish and its story – could educate and entice the audience. - User engagement: Check-ins and tags – The Old Crown should encourage patrons to check in on Facebook or tag the location on Instagram. Perhaps a small promotion like a monthly draw from those who checked in. This not only spreads awareness to their friends, it also improves the pub’s visibility in algorithmic recommendations (“Your friend visited Old Crown Girton…”). - Platform with most engagement: Likely, Facebook leads for local engagement (older locals and families, who comment and share in community circles). Instagram leads for broader appeal (students, foodies, tourists following hashtags). The pub’s task is to maintain both: use Facebook for community-building and event info, and Instagram for branding and wider discovery.
Comparing to Competitors’ Online Presence: - Some competitors, like The Boot Histon, are backed by a corporate chain (Heartwood Inns) which gives them polished websites and regular social media content (The Boot’s page often posts dog-friendly photos, special offers, etc.). The Red Lion, being part of City Pub Co, also has a slick web presence and likely uses professional marketing content (e.g. promoting its boutique rooms, cocktail specials). The George in Girton, by contrast, is smaller scale; it has a basic website and uses a Facebook page for event updates, relying on grassroots community following. - The Old Crown’s advantage online is its unique angle (Nepalese menu) which has garnered attention from local bloggers (e.g. Cambridge Foodies wrote about it, highlighting it as something new in the area[28][29]). That kind of organic PR is invaluable – competitors mostly advertise the usual pub fare, while Old Crown’s story (“traditional pub reborn with Nepalese cuisine”) stands out. Ensuring that story is told consistently across its digital platforms will differentiate it. - In terms of SEO, some competitors’ websites might rank for certain terms (The Plough Coton, for example, might appear in searches for “gastropub Cambridge” due to its accolades). The Old Crown’s site should be optimized to rank for the specific local terms identified (as discussed in section 2). A quick technical look shows the Old Crown’s site is part of the Lapen Inns group, which likely provides good SEO structure. It should utilize schema markup for local business, menu pages, etc., to stay on par or ahead of others.
Local Directories & Citations: The pub is listed on Google My Business (Google Maps), which is critical. It should also ensure consistency of Name, Address, Phone (NAP) info on: - TripAdvisor, Yelp, Bing Places, Apple Maps, Facebook, Instagram, etc. - Niche sites like CAMRA’s WhatPub (it is listed there with details[30][31]) – that’s great for ale enthusiasts. - Visit South Cambs tourism site (it’s mentioned there as a family-friendly pub[32]). - Perhaps get listed in Cambridge restaurant guides (Cambridge News often does “Top 10 pubs” articles – reaching out to be included or advertising in such features can help). - A presence on OpenTable or ResDiary for online bookings could be considered if demand for reservations grows (currently, they use a booking link via togo, which is fine; being on OpenTable might increase visibility to a certain segment, though it comes with fees).
Website Performance: The Old Crown’s website needs to support its digital presence. A quick audit: - SEO: The site should have unique title tags and meta descriptions for each page (e.g. Home, Menu, About, Events) containing keywords like “Girton pub”, “Cambridge Nepalese restaurant”. It’s beneficial that the site explicitly mentions location and offerings on the homepage (it does: “pub and restaurant in the heart of Girton… extensive Nepalese cuisine”[33] – good for SEO). - Mobile Optimization: Given many users will find the site on mobile (from Google or social links), it must be mobile-friendly. The design appears modern and likely responsive. Fast loading images and easy navigation (click-to-call phone number, tap to open map directions) are essential. - Site Speed: The pub should ensure images are optimized (not too large) and any unnecessary plugins are removed, since a slow site can frustrate users (especially those on the go looking for quick info like menu or hours). - Content: Does the site answer key questions? It has sections for Menu, Booking, About, Gallery, Events, Contact[34] – which is good. The menu page should ideally be text-based (for SEO and accessibility) rather than just PDFs, and highlight dietary options (vegetarian, gluten-free) since many online visitors look for that. The Events/News section shows the pub is actively updating with news (like sports events announcements[35]) – this is excellent for both SEO (fresh content) and user info. Keeping that up-to-date will encourage repeat visits to the site. - Schema Markup: If not already implemented, adding LocalBusiness schema and perhaps Menu schema can help Google display rich info (like review stars, price range, cuisine type in search results).
Engagement & Feedback: The pub should actively use digital feedback for improvements. For instance: - Poll followers on social media: “What new beer would you like to see on tap?” or “Would you attend a live music night if we hosted one?”. This not only boosts engagement but provides market research. - Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews on Google/TripAdvisor. Perhaps put a gentle note at the end of the menu or bill like “Enjoyed your visit? Please consider reviewing us online – it helps a local business greatly!”. - Monitor mentions: Set up Google Alerts or use social listening for “Old Crown Girton” to catch any blogs or posts about the pub and engage/share them (the Cambridge Edition review and CambridgeFoodies blog are examples of positive press to share on the pub’s channels).
Comparison with Competitors’ Engagement: By observing competitors: The George likely relies on its Beer Festival and events to generate Facebook buzz (which it does well in local circles). The Boot and Red Lion have professional marketing – but they cover a broader area, whereas Old Crown’s marketing can be hyper-local and personalized. The pub can for example share a photo congratulating the Girton Colts if they win a tournament and they celebrated at the pub – something a corporate competitor might overlook, but which gets huge local goodwill.
Areas to Improve: - Increase visual content: maybe invest in a short promo video (even 30 seconds) showing the pub, the food, patrons smiling – pin that to Facebook and put on the website’s about page. Video content is engaging and can be shared. - Ensure all digital touchpoints encourage conversion: e.g., on social media “Book Now” buttons/link, on Google listing use the Reservation URL feature, on TripAdvisor ensure the “Reserve” or “Call” options are enabled. - Email Marketing: Does the pub have a mailing list? Collecting emails from reservation bookings or a sign-up sheet at the bar for a newsletter can allow direct communication of events/offers to interested customers. Even a monthly “What’s on at the Old Crown” email can drive repeat visits. (Mailchimp free tier could suffice to start.)
In conclusion, the Old Crown’s digital presence is strong and should continue to be nurtured. The strategy is to amplify the positive reputation it already has by engaging more with the community online, telling its unique story, and making it as easy as possible for people to find information and choose the pub. By staying responsive and proactive online, the Old Crown will not only attract new customers but also build a loyal online community that champions the pub (essentially turning happy customers into digital advocates). In the competitive landscape of local pubs, an engaged digital fanbase and sterling online reviews are invaluable assets that the Old Crown must maintain and grow.
7. Local SEO Technical Research
Optimizing for local SEO involves fine-tuning the pub’s presence on Google and other local search platforms, as well as ensuring consistent citations across the web. Here we delve into technical aspects like Google My Business, local directories, and other back-end SEO factors relevant to the Old Crown:
Google My Business (GMB) Optimization: The GMB listing is arguably the most important asset for local search visibility. The Old Crown already has a listing (with many positive reviews and photos). To maximize it: - Categories: GMB allows a primary category and secondary categories. Currently it might be set to “Pub” or “Gastropub”. Given the unique dual nature of the Old Crown, it could use a combination: for example, primary category “Pub” (to appear for generic pub searches), and secondary category “Nepalese Restaurant” or “Asian Fusion Restaurant” to capture cuisine-specific searches. It’s important the primary category reflects what most people search (likely “pub” or “restaurant”). The pub should research what competitors use: if The George is listed as “Pub” and restaurants like a nearby curry house are “Indian Restaurant”, perhaps “Nepalese Restaurant” as secondary will differentiate. In any case, category tuning can affect discovery for “near me” queries (someone searching “restaurants near me” might not see the pub if only categorized as pub – adding “restaurant” covers that angle). - Attributes: GMB provides various attributes that appear as icons or descriptors (e.g. “Family-friendly”, “Outdoor seating”, “Live music”, “Vegetarian options”, etc.). The Old Crown should regularly update these. Key attributes to set: Outdoor seating (Yes), Takeaway (Yes), Dine-in (Yes), Alcohol served (Yes – it’s a pub), Good for groups, Good for kids, Reservations accepted, Wi-Fi (Yes), Live sports (if they show them), LGBTQ+ friendly, etc. These not only inform customers but also feed Google’s algorithm for answering specific queries (e.g. if someone filters Google Maps for “pet-friendly pubs”, having “Dogs allowed” ticked will include Old Crown). - Photos and Videos: GMB photos significantly influence engagement. The Old Crown should regularly upload high-quality images: interior ambience (cozy fireplace, seating areas), exterior (the thatched roof and signage, maybe a nice dusk shot when lights are on), and drool-worthy food shots (a colourful curry, a Sunday roast platter, pints in the sun). According to some studies, businesses with 100+ photos on GMB get more hits – so quantity (with quality) helps. Also, encourage patrons to upload their photos (many already do). Short videos can be added too (like a 15-second clip scanning the pub interior or a busy Friday vibe). These rich media elements make the listing stand out. - Posts and Updates: GMB has a feature for posts (updates, offers, events). The Old Crown can use this like a micro-social media: post about an upcoming event (“Live Music this Saturday – join us!”), a special offer (“Happy Hour 3-5pm weekdays”), or seasonal greetings. These posts show up in the knowledge panel and can catch eyes of potential customers. For example, a “Nepalese Food Festival Week” post could intrigue a user enough to click. - Q&A Section: Google listings allow users to ask questions. Often, common ones might be “Do I need to book?” or “Is there parking?” or “Are dogs allowed inside?”. It’s wise for the Old Crown to seed some FAQ there using a personal Google account (it’s not against guidelines for owners to ask and answer common questions transparently). For instance, post a question “Do you have parking on site?” and then answer it as the owner (Yes, we have a car park behind the pub with approx 15 spaces, plus street parking on High Street). This pre-empts confusion – and since many people might wonder but not ask, it’s helpful to have it visible. Monitor this section so any customer questions get answered promptly (Google may notify the owner, but checking manually is good too). - Ensure Accuracy: Double-check that all info on GMB is correct and complete: opening hours (including special hours for holidays – Google allows setting those in advance), phone number (the one that is answered during open hours), website link (already there, presumably), and menu link (if a PDF or menu page can be linked). Also the address should exactly match what’s on the website and other listings (for NAP consistency). The Old Crown’s address and phone should be formatted consistently everywhere (e.g. always “89 High St, Girton, Cambridge CB3 0QD” and “01223 277217”).
Local Citations & Directories: Consistency and breadth of citations improve local SEO: - The Old Crown should audit major UK directories: Yell.com, Thomson Local, Scoot, and others to ensure it’s listed. For example, a Yell search shows “Pubs near Girton” with possibly Old Crown in results[36]. If not claimed, claim those listings. - TripAdvisor: Already covered – maintain that listing with updated menus and respond to reviews. It’s #1 of 3 in Girton[37], which is great. - Facebook Business: The Facebook page acts as a citation too – ensure address/phone hours mirror GMB. - Instagram location: Make sure there’s a single geotag for Old Crown Girton that people use when tagging – this might tie to Facebook’s place database. - Visit Cambridge / Tourist sites: If not listed, get on “VisitCambridge” or the official tourism site’s listings for Pubs or Restaurants. Sometimes they require a membership or request, but it can drive tourist footfall. - Local Chamber of Commerce or Business Associations: South Cambridgeshire might have a business directory or the Cambridge Chamber might allow restaurants as members which can lead to networking or listing on their site. - Google’s Local Press: Getting featured in local online news (Cambridge Independent, Cambridge News, Cambs Edition) not only boosts reputation but creates high-quality backlinks (for SEO). The Cambridge Edition review[38][39] is a positive example – the pub’s site should link to that or quote it (as social proof) and keep such relationships warm (invite local journalists to events). - NAP Consistency: It’s worth doing a scan of the pub’s name online – ensure no old phone numbers or incorrect addresses linger from previous management. For example, if prior to 2019 it had a different number, some sites might still show it; reaching out to update those is beneficial.
Technical SEO on Website: - Implement LocalBusiness schema with all details (name, address, phone, opening hours, menu URL). Also implement GeoCoordinates or at least specify city/area to reinforce location. - If the website has multiple venues (it’s part of Lapen Inns), ensure the Old Crown’s page has unique meta tags focusing on Girton/Cambridge. - Backlinks: Local SEO is boosted by backlinks from relevant local sites. The pub could engage in local SEO/link-building by: - Sponsoring a local cause (often results in a thank-you mention + link on that organization’s site). - Hosting a blogger event (Cambridge food bloggers come and review – they link to the site in their blogs). - Getting included in list articles (“Top 10 pubs around Cambridge”) on sites like Cambridgeshire Live or travel blogs – proactively reach out to authors of such pieces to consider Old Crown now that it’s Nepalese (a unique hook). - Ensuring continuity of older links: the Old Crown might have had different websites or pages in the past; set up 301 redirects if any old domain exists or if any site references “oldcrowngirton.co.uk” vs the current domain (looks like it is still oldcrowngirton.com active).
Google Maps Behavior: People often go straight to maps to find directions or see where a place is. The pub’s pin on Google Maps should have an accurate marker (check that it’s exactly on the building). Adding Google 360° photos or a short Virtual Tour inside can enhance the listing (this can be done via a Trusted Photographer if budget allows). Also, encourage more Google reviews with text, especially ones that mention specific qualities (“family-friendly”, “Nepalese cuisine”) because Google’s algorithm sometimes highlights keywords from reviews when matching queries.
Bing and Apple: Don’t forget to claim the Bing Places listing and ensure Apple Maps has the right info (Apple uses Yelp and TripAdvisor data partly – since those are good, Apple should be fine, but checking can’t hurt). Many iPhone users rely on Apple Maps by default for “pubs near me”.
Advanced Local SEO: - The pub could create some locally-focused content on the site – e.g. a blog post about “Top things to do in Girton” that naturally mentions the pub, or “Our favorite local suppliers in Cambridgeshire”. This not only provides useful info (and might get backlinks if others reference it) but also signals local relevance. - Use of keywords in HTML: Title tag could be “Old Crown Girton – Pub and Nepalese Restaurant in Cambridge” (covering location and offering). The meta description can mention serving Girton, Cambridge, Histon, etc., to catch people searching those terms. - Ensure mobile page speed is good – Google’s mobile-first indexing means any slow or poorly optimized mobile experience can hurt rankings, especially for mobile-heavy local queries. Tools like Google PageSpeed or Lighthouse can audit this.
Google My Business Insights & Tracking: The pub should periodically review the GMB Insights data (which shows how many searches found them, what queries were used, how many map vs search views, and actions like calls or direction requests). This data can inform marketing – e.g. if many people request directions from Cambridge city center, maybe focus an ad there; or if a lot of people call on Monday morning maybe asking about opening, ensure Monday hours are clear.
Name, Address, Phone (NAP) consistency issues:
- The pub’s name historically might appear as “Old Crown” or “The Old Crown” – ideally decide on one (most likely “Old Crown Girton”) and use that in all references. It seems to consistently be called Old Crown Girton on TripAdvisor and others, which is good to differentiate from any other Old Crown pubs in the UK. - The address should always include “Girton, Cambridge” to tie it to the city in searches (which it does). - Phone number: use the format +44 1223 277217 on the website (international format) as well to cover overseas tourists looking pre-trip.
Local Links & Associations: - Consider joining Cambridge Sustainable Food or similar networks if using local produce – they often list member businesses. - The pub might join Cambridge CAMRA’s Ale Trails if they do them – being on a CAMRA ale trail map can bring in ale enthusiasts and yields mention on CAMRA websites or leaflets. - Being active in the Girton community Facebook group (not spamming, but occasionally sharing a community-focused update) can drive hyper-local awareness – many villages have informal rules, but if say the Feast organizers allow posts from local businesses supporting the Feast, that’s a chance to shine.
By addressing these technical and citation factors, the Old Crown will strengthen its Local SEO foundation. The aim is that whenever someone in Cambridge or the vicinity searches for any term related to pubs, restaurants, or Girton, the Old Crown’s presence is prominent and consistent. Proper GMB optimization combined with broad, accurate citations can significantly improve the pub’s chances of appearing in the coveted Google “3-pack” for searches like “pub Girton” or “best pub Cambridge north”, thereby driving more clicks and foot traffic.
8. Content Opportunities Research
Creating engaging, locally-relevant content will not only improve SEO but also help connect the Old Crown with its community on a deeper level. We’ve identified several content angles and story ideas that the pub can develop over time:
1. Historic and Cultural Content: The Old Crown’s rich history and the heritage of Girton provide excellent storytelling material. For example: - “History of The Old Crown” Article or Blog: Detail the origin of the pub, the significance of its thatched roof, notable moments (perhaps war time anecdotes, refurbishments). Include any old photographs (maybe source from local historical societies or long-term residents) to show how it looked decades ago. Highlight tidbits like being possibly the largest thatched pub in the country[15], or stories of former landlords. This content would fascinate locals (who love to reminisce) and intrigue visitors interested in English pub history. - Girton Village History Series: The pub could start a blog series spotlighting local history or landmarks. One post might focus on Girton College’s founding and how the village supported it, another on St Andrew’s Church and village traditions, etc., weaving in the pub where possible (like “and after the annual harvest service, villagers have often gathered at the Old Crown since the 1800s…”). This positions the pub as a guardian of local lore. - Cultural Fusion Story: Since the pub now offers Nepalese cuisine in a classic British pub setting, a great content piece would be “Bringing Nepalese Cuisine to a British Village Pub – The Story Behind Our Menu.” This could be an interview with the owner or chef about why they chose Nepalese, the challenges and joys of introducing these flavors to locals, and maybe background on any signature dishes (e.g. explaining what momo dumplings are, or the spices that go into a curry). This not only educates customers (making them more likely to try the food) but also underscores the uniqueness of the Old Crown. - Meet the Team: Content that humanizes the business can be very effective. Short profiles of the chef, the manager, or the long-standing bartender with their favorite dish or drink, how they ended up at the Old Crown, etc. For instance, “Meet our Head Chef – [Name], who grew up in Kathmandu and now brings his family recipes to Girton” or conversely, “Meet our General Manager – [Name], a Girton native who has seen the pub through all its changes.” These stories build a personal connection and trust.
2. Community Spotlights and Partnerships: The pub can strengthen community ties by featuring others: - Local Supplier Spotlights: If the Old Crown uses any local suppliers (perhaps a local butcher for meats, a nearby farm for vegetables, or a local Cambridge brewery for certain ales), it’s great content to showcase them. E.g., “We get our beef from XX Farm just 5 miles away – here’s a day we visited the farm” with photos. This shows commitment to local business and quality ingredients (something the Boot and others do on their sites[40]). Even if most supplies are from general distributors, find any unique angles – maybe the beer “Cambridge Bitter” comes from Elgood’s Brewery in Cambridgeshire[41], which could be a mini story: “Ever wonder what’s in your pint? Our regular ale is locally brewed in Wisbech…”. - Community Heroes: Use the pub’s platform to celebrate local figures or groups. Perhaps a blog interview with the organizer of Girton Feast, or the captain of the Girton cricket team (especially if the pub sponsors them). Showing that the Old Crown cares about local people’s achievements fosters goodwill. For example, “The Old Crown Chats With… [Local Teacher raising money for charity]” – and then mention if you’re supporting that cause (like hosting their fundraiser). - Staff Community Involvement: If pub staff participate in local events (maybe the pub has a team running a 5K charity race, or bartenders volunteer at the Feast), those stories can be shared. It reinforces that the pub’s people are part of the community fabric, not just serving it.
3. Seasonal and Holiday Content: Tie content creation to the seasons and holidays: - “How We Celebrate [Holiday] at Old Crown”: For Christmas, a blog with photos of the pub’s festive decor, the special pudding on the menu, maybe a note about the staff Secret Santa – it spreads holiday cheer and markets the offerings subtly. Similarly, a piece on “Winter in Girton – Warm up at the Old Crown” could talk about things to do in a chilly Girton (like winter walks around the village or attending carols) and ending at the pub for a hot toddy by the fire. - Recipes or Cooking Tips: With Nepalese cuisine as a hook, consider occasionally sharing a recipe or cooking tip. For instance, “Our Chef’s Recipe for Traditional Nepalese Dahl” or “5 Tips to Perfect Yorkshire Puddings from our kitchen”. People love behind-the-scenes and may try it at home – but it mostly builds appreciation for the craft (and they’ll come to taste the real thing). These can be blog posts or short social media videos. - Event Recaps: After hosting events (a trivia night, a beer tasting, a live music evening), do a little recap post: “Last Friday’s Quiz Night Recap – Meet the Winning Team!” with their photo (with permission). This not only acknowledges those who came (which they love – and will share that post with friends “look we’re on the pub’s page!”) but also shows those who didn’t come what they missed, encouraging attendance next time.
4. Food and Drink Focused Content: - Menu Spotlights: With such an extensive menu (Nepalese + pub classics), systematically highlight items. A blog series could be “Dish of the Week” explaining one dish’s origins or ingredients. For example, “Exploring Nepalese Cuisine: The Story of momo” – an article describing what momo dumplings are, how they’re made, and inviting readers to try them at the pub. This has SEO benefits too (capturing people searching for Nepalese dish terms in Cambridge). - Dietary Options: Content reassuring various customer segments can be helpful: a short post about vegetarian or vegan options available (“Vegetarian Dining at Old Crown – More than Just Salad” highlighting veg Nepali dishes and maybe a nut roast on Sundays) could appeal to that audience and capture search queries. Similarly, if gluten-free or allergies are accommodated, an informative page can both showcase hospitality and hit SEO keywords. - Drink Pairings: The pub can leverage its bar offerings in content. “Beer and Curry: What Ales Pair Best with Our Nepalese Dishes” – perhaps recommending a hoppy IPA with spicy curry vs a lager with milder dishes. Or a guide: “Our 5 Local Ales You Should Try at Old Crown”. With frequent mentions of local breweries or specific brands, you might even get those brands to share your content, extending reach. - Event Tie-in Content: If planning a special event, create content around it. Example: before a planned Gin Tasting Night, write “The History of Gin in Cambridge and What to Expect at Our Tasting Night” – it educates and doubles as an event promo. If hosting a Nepali cultural event (say to celebrate Nepali New Year or something), write about that festival and how the pub will celebrate – cross-cultural content like that stands out.
5. Collaborations & Cross-Promotion: - Local Business Partnerships: Teaming up with complementary local businesses can yield content and mutual promotion. For instance, partner with a local bike tour company: write a blog “Cycling from Cambridge? Stop by Old Crown in Girton” which goes on your site, and they mention your pub in their route maps. Or partner with Girton Golf Club: “A Day of Golf in Girton – Finish at the Old Crown 19th Hole” – put that on their newsletter maybe. - Charity Content: If the pub does charity drives (like collecting for a food bank or sponsoring a cause), document it. “Old Crown’s Charity Quiz raises £X for [Charity] – Thank you!” This shows community values and makes for shareable positive news.
6. Utilizing Local Landmarks in Content: As a pub near Cambridge, tourists might be googling attractions + where to eat. Creating content that references local attractions can capture that synergy: - “Visiting the Cambridge American Cemetery? We’re 5 minutes away – here’s why you should drop by.” That piece can tactfully provide value (maybe a bit on the cemetery’s significance and then segue to the pub for lunch). - “Top 5 Countryside Walks Near Cambridge (with Pub Stops)” – include a route via Girton, naturally featuring Old Crown. People search for walking routes with pubs, so this could draw ramblers. - “Guide to North Cambridge Villages” – highlight Girton, Histon, etc. and note the pub as a must-visit in Girton.
7. User-Generated Content & Engagement: Encourage customers to be part of your content: - Run a photo contest: e.g. “Post your best photo at Old Crown, tag us, and win a free dinner.” Then compile the entries in a blog or Facebook album (“Our Customers Through the Season – Photo Gallery”). - Testimonials: Share standout review quotes as graphics on social media or a testimonial section on the website. E.g. “‘A hidden gem with amazing Nepalese food’ – Google review, July 2025.” This is content derived from user feedback and adds credibility. - Collect questions from customers (in person or online) and publish a Q&A article: “You Asked, We Answered: 10 Questions about The Old Crown” – covering things from “Do we allow dogs?” to “Can you handle large group bookings?” etc., with detailed answers (which doubles as an FAQ resource on site).
Overall, these content ideas serve multiple purposes: improving SEO (through keyword-rich, locally relevant topics), engaging the community (by highlighting local stories and involving patrons), and marketing subtly (telling the pub’s story and offerings without always feeling like an advertisement). A well-structured content calendar could schedule these throughout the year, ensuring a steady stream of fresh content.
Crucially, the content should be authentic and aligned with the Old Crown’s brand – which is a friendly village pub with an international twist and community heart. By consistently creating content that people find interesting or useful, the Old Crown will not only boost its search rankings but also solidify its reputation as not just a place to eat and drink, but a cornerstone of local culture and conversation.
9. Mobile & Local Search Behavior
Modern customers increasingly rely on mobile devices and voice-assisted searches to find local businesses. Understanding these behaviors helps the Old Crown ensure it’s highly visible and user-friendly in those contexts.
Dominance of Mobile Searches: A large portion of people searching for pubs or restaurants do so from their smartphones, especially when on-the-go. They might be in Cambridge city centre searching “pub near Girton” as they plan an outing, or a Girton local at home asking Siri for “restaurants open now”. It’s estimated that well over 60-70% of local searches happen on mobile devices now, and a majority of “near me” searches happen on mobile because users want immediate results and directions. This means the Old Crown’s mobile optimization is critical: the website should load quickly on 3G/4G, have readable text without zoom, and buttons large enough to tap (especially the phone number and map links).
Voice Search Trends: With voice assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa) becoming commonplace, many users conduct searches by voice in a conversational tone. Instead of typing “girton pub hours”, they might ask, “What time does the Old Crown in Girton close tonight?” or “Where can I get Nepalese food near me?”. Voice searches often take the form of questions or longer phrases. To capture these: - Ensure that on the website, content is phrased in natural language where possible. Having an FAQ section with Q&A format can directly align with how voice queries are structured (e.g., Q: “Do you have vegetarian options?” A: “Yes, we offer several vegetarian dishes…”). - The GMB listing should be up-to-date because voice assistants pull answers from there often. For example, if someone asks “Does the Old Crown Girton do takeaway?”, Google might look at the attributes or even user Q&A on the listing for the answer. - Also consider adding a blog post titled in a question form like “What’s the best pub in Girton?” which, while a bit self-serving, can be written objectively listing pubs and highlighting Old Crown, thereby potentially getting picked as a voice snippet.
“Near Me” and Proximity Searches: When someone searches “pubs near me” or uses Google Maps to find nearby dining, the search engine utilizes location data. For the Old Crown, this underscores: - The importance of consistent NAP and geo-tags as mentioned (so Google knows exactly where you are). - Garnering strong review ratings – the Google Maps algorithm heavily factors rating and number of reviews for rankings. Old Crown’s high 4.5+ average will help it appear near the top for searches in its vicinity. - Encouraging user engagement on the listing (photos, reviews, Q&A) as that richness can sometimes set a listing apart in map results. - Being open at key times: Many “near me” searches include “open now”. If, say, someone searches at 9:30pm for “restaurants near me open now” and Old Crown closes at 10pm, it will show up. If it closed at 9:00, it wouldn’t. So aligning hours with common dining times (the pub is open late which is good) means it captures those searches. Google’s stats show terms like “open now near me” have skyrocketed in recent years[42].
Google Maps Behavior: Customers often do not click through to websites – they make decisions right within Google Maps or Google’s Knowledge Panel. They might scroll photos, skim top reviews, check distance/directions, and press “Call” or “Navigate”. We need to ensure: - The photos on Maps/GMB are appealing (we covered that). - The review snippets that show are positive – Google often shows a few keywords from reviews on the listing (like “family friendly” or “Nepalese menu was delicious”). By having customers mention important phrases in reviews, it helps. If no one has, it might be worth subtly encouraging: for example, if a regular expresses love for something, ask if they’d mention that in a review because it helps others find the pub for that feature. - The “Directions” function should correctly bring people to the parking or main entrance. If the map pin is slightly off (for instance, on a back alley), it could mislead. It seems correct at 89 High St, but just something to verify.
Information At-a-Glance: Mobile searchers often want quick info: - Hours: Should be instantly visible (and updated for holidays, as nothing frustrates more than driving somewhere that Google said was open but it’s closed for a holiday). The pub should use the Google My Business special hours feature for holidays well in advance. - Contact: On mobile, the phone number on the website and GMB is tap-to-call. Test it. Many will just hit “Call” from the Google listing. Ensure calls are answered during open hours. Maybe even have a simple phone menu if expecting a lot of calls (e.g. press 1 to book, 2 for directions – but only if necessary; often a human pickup is best for a pub). - Menu Access: Mobile users might want to quickly see the menu. Having a text menu on the site that’s mobile-friendly is ideal. If it’s a PDF, make sure it’s a small file and labeled clearly (“View Menu”). Also, linking the menu on the GMB listing via the “Menu URL” field is smart – so on mobile, the listing itself has a “Menu” button that opens it. - Integration with Maps Navigation: Many people will just navigate to the pub via Google or Apple Maps. Ensuring the address is correct is the main thing. Also, if parking is tricky, the website could mention “Parking available behind pub, entrance on Dodford Lane” or such, as some diligent users will check the site for parking details.
Voice Search Queries Examples (and how to target them): - “What’s the best pub in Girton?” – having a blog post or even a line on the site “voted best pub in Girton” (if applicable via TripAdvisor rating) could match this. - “Where can I get Nepalese food near Cambridge?” – ensure the site and GMB mention “Nepalese cuisine near Cambridge” explicitly. Perhaps a testimonial: “This is the best Nepalese food you can find near Cambridge” – if a review said that and you quote it on your site, you might catch that query. - “Does Old Crown Girton have Wi-Fi?” – mark that ‘Free WiFi’ on GMB and mention in FAQ on site (“Yes, we offer free Wi-Fi to our guests – just ask staff for the password.”). - “Is Old Crown Girton dog friendly?” – again, address on website or Google Q&A (“We are dog-friendly in the bar and garden areas, water bowls available.”). Many people use voice to ask those specific questions. - “How far is Old Crown from Cambridge city centre?” – Could mention “only 3 miles from Cambridge city centre” on the homepage[33] which it does. That covers such distance queries.
Leveraging Mobile for Engagement: Consider that mobile users often will use the “click to call” or “get directions” immediately if they like what they see. According to Google, a high percentage of mobile local searches result in action (visiting or calling) within a day[43][14]. The Old Crown’s aim should be to make those actions frictionless: - Keep the phone line staffed or at least with a professional voicemail (in case someone calls to book outside hours, the voicemail could say “Thanks for calling Old Crown, to reserve a table please visit our website or call back after 11am” – and mention hours). - If using any booking system, ensure it’s mobile-friendly (the current “Book Now” via togo.uk looks to be mobile-compatible, which is good). - Use SMS or messaging: Perhaps enable the Facebook page’s messaging or WhatsApp Business. Some people prefer to message rather than call. If manageable, the pub could allow table reservations or inquiries via Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, which are often used on mobile. Quick responses are key if enabling that.
Map Pack and Local Pack Ranking: - The Old Crown currently likely appears in the local 3-pack for “Girton pub” queries (given the small competition pool). For broader searches like “pub Cambridge”, it may not, but for “pub near [north Cambridge landmark]” it might if close enough. Using localized website content (like having Cambridge mentioned, which it does, and Girton in many contexts) signals to Google that it’s relevant to those searches too. - Garnering more Google reviews mentioning “Cambridge” or “near Cambridge” might even help – sometimes Google highlights reviews that match the search query. If someone wrote “It’s worth the short trip from Cambridge for this pub!”, that could surface for a Cambridge search.
Adapting to Quick Info Needs: People often just want specific info: hours, address, menu, contact. The pub’s job is to put those front and center on mobile mediums: - The website’s homepage should have a clear snippet like “📍 89 High St, Girton, CB3 – ⏰ Open today 12pm-10pm – ☎️ 01223 277217” perhaps near the top or bottom in text (text so that search engines read it, not just in an image). - On mobile, a sticky header or footer with a call button and directions link could be user-friendly (if the site design supports that). - Utilizing Google’s “Order Online” or “Reserve a Table” buttons if available. For instance, Google might allow integration so that a “Reserve” button appears (via OpenTable or others). Since you have your own booking link, it might not show, but if they partner with certain systems, consider integrating for ease (though not critical if your own system is working).
Adapting Marketing for Mobile Behavior: - Many people will see social media posts on mobile and click through. So any landing pages should be mobile-optimized. For example, if running a Facebook ad for an event, ensure the event page or details are easily read on a phone. - SMS marketing: It might not be in play yet, but some pubs use SMS for confirmations or promotions (with permission). Given the pub has GMB messaging and possibly could use WhatsApp, exploring those channels carefully could be future consideration.
User Journey on Mobile: For instance, imagine a user scenario: - “Alex is with friends in North Cambridge on a Saturday afternoon. One says, ‘Let’s get a pint somewhere not too far, maybe a bite too.’ Alex pulls out his phone and says ‘Hey Google, find a pub near me with food.’” - Google returns a map with a few options; because the Old Crown is 2 miles away and highly rated with mentions of food, it shows up. Alex sees “Old Crown Girton – 4.6★ – Nepalese menu – Open until 11:00pm” and a photo of the pub garden. This stands out because the other options might just say “Pub – closes at 10”. They click it, quickly scroll reviews (“friendly, great food” – good) and then hit directions using Google Maps. The entire decision was made within the Google interface on mobile in under 2 minutes. The only things influencing him were the rating, open hours, description, and photos. - This illustrates how critical the GMB/Maps info is on mobile. The pub needs to keep those elements top-notch. That snippet of description that appears (usually first sentence of Google’s description or categories) should mention food or unique selling point (it does: “Pub offering Nepalese menu…” as per TripAdvisor snippet[44]). - Another scenario: “Priya is driving back from Huntingdon to Cambridge on A14 around 7pm with family, they want dinner. She asks Siri, ‘Find family restaurants near me.’” - If Old Crown is properly categorized and has “Good for kids” in attributes, Siri (via Apple Maps/Yelp) might list it. They might then call via Siri or CarPlay. The ease of finding and contacting is key. So being on Apple Maps with correct info and on Yelp (which Apple often pulls from) is also necessary.
In summary, to capture the increasingly mobile-local audience, the Old Crown should ensure every digital touchpoint is mobile-friendly, voice-search friendly, and provides instant gratification (be it an immediate answer, one-click call, or easy navigation). By doing so, the pub stays accessible to users at the precise moment they have the intent to visit a pub – which in turn drives more spontaneous visits and steady footfall.
10. Implementation Priorities
Given the breadth of research and opportunities identified, it’s important to tackle the improvements in phases. Below is a breakdown of Phase 1 (Immediate), Phase 2 (Short-term), and Phase 3 (Long-term) action items, along with their focus areas:
Phase 1 – Immediate Priorities (0–3 months):
•	Comprehensive Competitor Analysis & Positioning: Begin by digesting the competitor insights gathered. Create an internal report or matrix comparing Old Crown vs. competitors on key factors (menu variety, prices, ambiance, events, reviews). Identify Old Crown’s unique value proposition clearly – e.g. “The only pub in the area offering authentic Nepalese cuisine along with traditional British pub experience”. This positioning will guide all marketing messaging. Phase 1 is about solidifying what sets the Old Crown apart and ensuring staff and marketing materials consistently communicate that USP.
•	Primary Keyword Strategy & On-Site SEO: Using the keyword research, compile a prioritized list of local SEO keywords – including search volume estimates and difficulty. Focus on those with high intent (like “Girton restaurant”, “Nepalese food Cambridge”) and ensure the website’s pages target these. Concretely, update page titles, meta descriptions, and headings on the website:
•	Homepage title could be “Old Crown Girton – Pub & Nepalese Restaurant in Cambridge, UK” (hits Girton, pub, Nepalese, Cambridge).
•	Create or refine an SEO-friendly About page to include historical keywords (“historic Girton pub”, “Cambridge village pub since 1840”).
•	Ensure the Menu page has textual content describing the food (for search indexing of dish names and terms like “Sunday roast Girton”, “vegan options Cambridge pub”).
•	Set up Google Search Console to monitor what queries are bringing traffic and adjust accordingly.
•	Google My Business (GMB) Audit & Optimization: Immediately log in to the GMB dashboard:
•	Verify all details (address, hours, phone, categories as discussed) are correct.
•	Upload a fresh batch of high-quality photos (interior, exterior, top dishes, happy customers if possible).
•	Fill out any missing info (attributes like “Good for kids”, add a thorough business description emphasizing local ties and unique menu).
•	Start making weekly posts on GMB (even if it’s duplicating social posts about events or specials).
•	Encourage a few more happy regulars to drop a Google review, especially if you know they’ll mention something unique (e.g. “Best curry in Cambridge!”).
•	This GMB tune-up will immediately improve the pub’s appearance in local search and maps.
•	Customer Review Analysis & Engagement: Analyze the existing reviews on Google, TripAdvisor, Facebook. Note if there are any common negatives to fix operationally (Phase 1 is a good time to fix low-hanging fruit like adding a couple more vegetarian dishes if someone noted lack of them, or retraining a staff member if service was mentioned). Simultaneously, begin responding to reviews: thank positive reviewers personally and professionally address any negatives (e.g. “We’re sorry the wait was long on your visit, we’ve since implemented… and would love to welcome you again.”). This responsiveness should be ongoing, but starting now sets the tone. Additionally, put in place a system to get new reviews: for example, end of meal comment cards or just staff politely asking patrons known to be happy regulars, “It would help us a lot if you leave a review online.” Since Phase 1 is immediate, even a subtle prompt on the bill or a small sign at the exit can remind people. More fresh positive reviews will boost local SEO and credibility quickly.
These Phase 1 tasks focus on building a strong foundation: clarity in positioning, being easily discoverable online, and ensuring the pub’s reputation and info are well-managed. Many are one-time or initial heavy-lift tasks (like website SEO tweaks, populating GMB) that will then just need maintenance.
Phase 2 – Short-Term Priorities (3–6 months):
•	Community Event Calendar & Partnerships: Develop a 12-month local event calendar. Using info from section 5, plot out dates like Girton Feast, university terms, holidays, sports finals, etc. For each, brainstorm at least one pub activity or promo. In Phase 2, start reaching out to organizers (e.g. contact the Girton Feast committee to discuss sponsorship or involvement). Also, identify potential partnership opportunities: maybe the local primary school PTA (sponsor their event in exchange for publicity), or Girton College’s JCR (offer to host a mixer). By the end of Phase 2, aim to have a couple of collaborations confirmed – e.g. “Old Crown will host the Girton Feast after-party” or “We’re official drinks sponsor for the village cricket tournament.” This cements community integration.
•	Seasonal Content Planning: With the event calendar in hand, create a content calendar aligning to it. Plan blog posts and social media themes for each month/season. For example, decide that in September you’ll publish the “Historic Old Crown” article (heritage angle for autumn), in December a “Christmas at Old Crown” video message from the team, in March a spotlight on spring menu etc. Also prepare content for big events (like a webpage for “Feast Week at Old Crown” ahead of time). During Phase 2, start creating or outsourcing the creation of these content pieces so you’re ahead of schedule. Having at least outlines or drafts for each upcoming season’s content means you won’t scramble later. Simultaneously, keep an eye on what does well (short-term analysis of social engagement) to refine topics.
•	Local Citation Audit & Expansion: Do a systematic audit of the pub’s presence across the web. Using tools or manual search, find any inconsistencies or missing listings:
•	Correct any NAP mismatches (Phase 1 likely handled major ones; Phase 2 can dig deeper, e.g. minor directories or old articles that have outdated info – reach out to update them).
•	Actively submit the pub to additional relevant directories: e.g. “Cambridge Food and Drink directory”, “South Cambridgeshire business listings”, tourism sites. Ensure the pub is on Google-owned sites (like making sure Google Travel has it in the dining section).
•	Consider using services like Moz Local or Yext (if budget allows) to push consistent info to multiple platforms easily.
•	Also build out the TripAdvisor profile more in Phase 2: upload new management photos, update the description to reflect current offerings (mention the Nepalese menu prominently if not already).
•	By Phase 2 end, the goal is that if someone searches the pub’s name or any variant, they find consistent information, and if they search generic terms in various apps (TripAdvisor app, Yelp app, etc.), the pub appears.
•	Social Media Competitor Analysis & Strategy Refinement: Analyze what competitors and similar businesses are doing on social media:
•	E.g., monitor The Boot’s posts over a few months – do their food posts or event posts get more engagement? See how often Red Lion promotes its rooms or events.
•	Look at popular Cambridge food Instagram accounts and note what type of content gets high engagement (maybe aesthetic brunch pics or reels of food preparation).
•	Use those insights to adjust the Old Crown’s social strategy. For instance, if you notice gastropubs get lots of traction with behind-the-scenes chef videos, implement that. Or if local pubs get community love by posting old photos (“throwback Thursday: our pub in 1975”), do similar since Old Crown has history too.
•	Phase 2 should see the Old Crown’s social presence find a consistent voice and cadence. Perhaps decide: Facebook for weekly event updates and community shoutouts, Instagram for thrice-weekly gorgeous food/lifestyle shots, Twitter for daily specials or witty banter. A formalized plan will help maintain consistency and efficiency (e.g. using a scheduling tool like Hootsuite to queue posts).
•	Also consider paid social in Phase 2: maybe run a small Facebook Ads campaign targeting Cambridge residents highlighting the pub’s USP (“Experience Cambridge’s only Nepalese gastropub – 10 mins from city center!”) especially if any particular day needs a boost (like an offer to increase mid-week traffic).
Phase 3 – Long-Term Priorities (6–12+ months):
•	Historical and Advanced Content Development: Now that immediate and short-term content is rolling, Phase 3 can tackle more in-depth projects:
•	Historical Content Expansion: Perhaps consider compiling content into a small booklet or a section in the pub menu about its history (for on-premise interest). Or even working with local historians to uncover more stories for PR purposes. Possibly host a “history night” at the pub where locals share memories (and record that to use as content).
•	Interactive Content: As a longer-term idea, develop interactive or richer content – e.g. a short documentary-style video (~3-5 min) about the pub’s transformation (could be great on YouTube/Facebook). Or a virtual tour on the website (360 photos).
•	Content Refresh & Evergreen Guides: Revisit earlier blog posts to update them annually (important for SEO). For example, the “Top 5 pubs near Cambridge” post that features Old Crown should be updated with current info each year so it stays relevant. Build some evergreen pieces that will attract traffic long-term, like “Guide to Pub Etiquette for International Students” or “5 Must-Try Nepalese Dishes in Cambridge” – these are not time-bound and will draw visitors continuously.
•	Advanced Local Link Building: By Phase 3, focus on elevating the pub’s authority online. Identify local websites and blogs for link building opportunities:
•	Try to get an article in Cambridge Independent or Cambridge News about the pub (perhaps angle it as “the fusion pub trend” or an interview with the chef). These will come with quality backlinks.
•	Host a “media tasting night” where you invite local bloggers/Instagrammers – their coverage will yield links or at least social buzz.
•	Contribute to community websites – e.g. write an article for the Girton parish website about the pub’s role in the village (with a link back).
•	Ensure any school/church event you sponsor lists you on their site.
•	Perhaps join national pub or restaurant awards (even if small) – being listed as a nominee often gets you on their site. For instance, entering the pub in “Cambridge Food and Drink Awards” could get a mention online.
•	If the Lapen Inns group has a corporate site linking to its venues (it does list them[45]), that’s already a good backlink – maybe ask them to add a little descriptive text with keywords in that link.
•	Community Partnership Development: Deepen collaborations initiated in Phase 2:
•	Could you formalize a discount scheme with Girton College? e.g. a 10% student discount on Tuesdays – and the college lists that on their student info page or intranet.
•	Join the local chamber or business association to increase networking (maybe the chamber site lists members).
•	Partner with event organizers: For instance, become an annual partner of Girton Feast (each year you’re on their site/program, etc.).
•	Explore hosting regular charity events (like monthly quiz for charity) – invite local press to cover big charity cheques being handed over.
•	The aim is by a year or more out, the Old Crown is synonymous with community engagement. People in Girton think of it automatically for any gathering or cause. This intangible goodwill often translates into both direct traffic and indirect benefits (recommendations, etc.).
•	Brand Positioning Refinement: After implementing many changes, reassess how the brand is perceived:
•	Conduct a simple customer survey (online via Facebook or paper slips at tables) asking “What do you think of when you think of Old Crown?” or “How did you hear about us?”. See if the responses align with what you want (e.g., people now say “Nepalese food” or “community events” if those were goals).
•	Analyze sales data and foot traffic patterns – did the focus on families bring in more Sunday lunch trade? Are students showing up on quiz night now?
•	Based on feedback and data, you might tweak the strategy. For example, you might find the Nepalese angle is so successful that you lean even harder into it (maybe rebrand slightly in visuals to reflect that culture), or conversely find that some locals still miss certain British elements (so you ensure not to lose those).
•	Also look at online metrics: is the website ranking now for the target keywords? Which content got the most views or shares? Use that to iterate content strategy.
Throughout all phases, tracking success metrics (see below) will inform adjustments. Phase 3 is about consolidation and growth – building on momentum to entrench the Old Crown as a top local destination and a high-performing website in local search. It’s also about forward planning – by month 12, start conceptualizing next year’s campaigns (perhaps a big 2-year anniversary event since reopening, etc.).
By following these phased priorities, the team can tackle improvements in manageable chunks, ensuring early wins (Phase 1 quick SEO gains), sustained community integration (Phase 2 events and content), and long-term dominance in local mindshare and search rankings (Phase 3). It transforms the research insights into a realistic roadmap for execution.
 
Research Deliverables: Following this research, the expected outputs and tools to measure success include:
•	A Competitor Analysis Report detailing how Old Crown compares to local competitors and recommendations to differentiate (covering points from section 1, delivered as an internal document).
•	A Keyword Strategy Document listing target keywords, their search volumes, and content mapping (which pages or posts will target which terms).
•	Customer Persona Profiles (as outlined in section 4) that staff and marketers can use to tailor service and promotions – possibly printed as one-pagers for staff training.
•	A month-by-month Content Calendar for 12 months with proposed blog/social topics, tied to local events and seasonal opportunities (section 5 and 8 info).
•	A Local SEO Audit & Checklist (from sections 7 and 9) that ensures all technical items (GMB, citations, site SEO) have been addressed – this could be a spreadsheet to tick off.
•	A list of Community Partnership Opportunities with contacts and next steps (for example: “Girton Primary School Fair – contact PTA chair [Name] by Feb to discuss sponsorship” and so on, gathered from section 3 and 5 ideas).
•	A Seasonal Marketing/Event Calendar highlighting key dates and planned promotions (could be combined with content calendar but focusing on events and offers the pub will run each season).
•	Regular Progress Reports (maybe quarterly) to track success metrics (see below) and adjust strategy accordingly.
By delivering and then executing on these outputs, the Old Crown will have a concrete foundation and plan to boost its local search visibility, engage the community, and ultimately drive more foot traffic and revenue.
Success Metrics to Track: Finally, to gauge the impact of these efforts, the pub should monitor: - Local Search Rankings: e.g., track where “Girton pub”, “Nepalese restaurant Cambridge”, etc., rank in Google now vs. in 3, 6, 12 months. The goal is improvement in rank and appearance in map pack. - Google My Business Engagement: Google provides insights like how many times people viewed the listing, clicked “call”, requested directions, and visited the website from it. Increases in those numbers (views, calls, direction requests) will indicate growing interest. For example, a rise in direction requests week over week means more people are navigating to the pub. - Website Traffic from Local Searches: Use Google Analytics to see overall traffic growth, and specifically the portion coming from organic search and from within, say, 25-mile radius of Cambridge (Analytics can show location data). Also track if there’s an uptick in certain keyword queries (using Search Console data). - Online Review Quantity & Quality: Aim to increase the number of Google and TripAdvisor reviews. Perhaps set a goal like +50 Google reviews in the next year while maintaining an average above 4.5. Also qualitatively, see if new reviews mention the things you’re promoting (if after pushing “family friendly”, more reviews mention families, that’s a success sign of perception shift). - Social Media Engagement: Track followers count and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) from the local community. For instance, an increase in Facebook followers from the Cambridge area by 30% and average post reach going up would show more local buzz. Similarly, more tagged mentions on Instagram or use of your hashtag indicates growing presence. - Event Attendance & Community Participation: Did quiz nights or special events start off with 5 teams and grow to 10 teams participating? Are your Sunday roasts selling out on Mother’s Day due to promotions? Keep notes or counts. If the pub sponsors the Girton 5K run and 100 runners come (versus 50 last year when you didn’t sponsor), that’s a measure of community impact as well. - Customer Feedback: Beyond reviews, direct feedback from customers (“I saw you on Facebook” or “We came because of that blog post”) is golden. Train staff to casually ask new customers how they heard about the pub – this anecdotal data, collected consistently, will show which channels are really driving foot traffic.
By observing these metrics, the Old Crown team can celebrate wins (e.g. a jump to #1 on Google for a key term, or a flood of new faces at an event) and identify areas needing tweaks. Continuous improvement driven by data will ensure that the local SEO and marketing efforts truly translate into the end goal: a thriving pub that is top-of-mind in the community and easily found by any potential customer nearby.
