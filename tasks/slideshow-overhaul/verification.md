# Verification — Slideshow Overhaul

## Automated checks
- `npm run lint -- --dir components/slideshow` → **passed**
- `npm run build` → **passed** (Next.js 14.2.32 optimized build + sitemap generation)
- `npm run test:smoke` → **fails** (`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION: .ts` when executing `tests/testRunner.ts` under Node v22.12.0). No code regressions observed; harness requires ESM loader.

## Manual / functional spot checks
- Verified autoplay pauses when slideshow leaves viewport and resumes on re-entry.
- Confirmed pointer hover and keyboard focus suspend autoplay and resume after the configured delay.
- Used keyboard navigation to step through slides, ensuring live region updates and focus management work alongside the new control bar and indicators.
- Exercised touch + drag gestures to validate momentum skip logic (fast swipe skips 2–3 slides; slow swipe advances one).
- Checked ARIA semantics for controls, progress bar, and indicators via browser devtools Accessibility Tree.

## Follow-ups / caveats
- Smoke test suite still requires configuring Node/TS loader (`ts-node/register` or equivalent) for `tests/testRunner.ts` in this environment.
- Thumbnail indicator variant relies on primary slide imagery; consider adding pre-generated low-res assets if bandwidth budgets tighten.
