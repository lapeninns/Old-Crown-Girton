# Plan: Homepage Slideshow Deep Analysis

1. **Consolidate Architecture Context**
   - Map out involved files, component hierarchy, and data dependencies using research notes plus code review for `Showcase`, `DaisyUISlideshow`, and `slides.ts`.
   - Capture unused but related modules to highlight maintainability implications.

2. **Audit Features & State Flow**
   - Enumerate navigation patterns, autoplay behavior, responsive traits, and configuration options.
   - Trace local state variables, refs, effects, and event handlers to understand data flow and side effects.

3. **Evaluate Performance & Accessibility**
   - Inspect rendering approach, asset strategy, timers, and potential bottlenecks.
   - Review keyboard support, focus management, ARIA usage, and gaps against provided accessibility guidelines.

4. **Assess UX, Cross-Device, Security, and Testing Posture**
   - Critique interaction design, responsiveness, edge-case handling, and security/privacy considerations.
   - Survey existing automated tests or lack thereof; note quality gaps.

5. **Benchmark vs Best Practices**
   - Compare implementation to established carousel/slideshow patterns and relevant libraries.
   - Highlight anti-patterns or risk areas informed by broader industry guidance.

6. **Synthesize Deliverables**
   - Draft executive summary, detailed section-by-section analysis, ASCII component/state diagrams, and prioritized action backlog.
   - Provide code snippets or pseudo “before/after” examples supporting recommendations.
