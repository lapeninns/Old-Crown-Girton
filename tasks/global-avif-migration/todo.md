- [x] Backup raster images from `public/images` and `src/assets/images` into a timestamped folder.

- [x] Run the converter across all image directories and verify sample outputs.
- [ ] Update code/content references to prefer `.avif` primaries while preserving fallbacks.
- [ ] Run lint/type checks to validate changes.
