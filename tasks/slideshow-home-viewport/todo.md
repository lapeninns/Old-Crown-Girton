# TODO

- [x] Remove rigid viewport height clamps so slide height grows with content.
- [x] Keep flex/gap column but adjust padding/gaps for fluid growth.
- [x] Allow CTA labels to wrap while maintaining ≥44 px targets and focus rings.
- [ ] Double-check responsive typography + spacing on small vs large screens.
- [~] Run lint (expect unrelated repo errors). *Fails due to pre-existing lint debt; captured output.*
- [ ] Update verification checklist once testing completes.
