# Verification â€“ Events Special Booking CTA Banner

## Commands run
- `npm run lint`

## Result
- Command fails due to pre-existing lint errors elsewhere in the repo (unused variables, restricted Tailwind tokens, hook rules). No new issues reported for `app/events/page.tsx`.

## Manual checks
- Pending: load `/events` locally to visually confirm banner placement and interactions.
