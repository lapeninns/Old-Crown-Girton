# Verification â€“ Events Curry & Carols Highlight CTA

## Commands run
- `npm run lint`

## Result
- Lint still fails due to existing repository issues (unused vars, restricted Tailwind tokens, etc.). No new errors reported from the updated `app/events/page.tsx` section.

## Manual checks
- Pending: view `/events` locally to confirm highlight placement and CTA behaviour.
