# Verification â€“ Curry & Carols Coming Soon Page

## Commands run
- `npm run lint`

## Result
- Fails due to pre-existing lint errors unrelated to this change (unused vars, schema warnings, design-token guard, hook ordering in other files). No issues surfaced from `app/events/curry-and-carols/page.tsx`.

## Next steps
- Manual QA: open `/events/curry-and-carols` locally once dev server is running to confirm layout and structured data render. (Not run yet.)
