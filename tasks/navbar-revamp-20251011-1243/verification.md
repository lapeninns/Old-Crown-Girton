# Verification Report

## DevTools Manual QA
**Tool Used**: Chrome DevTools (MCP) — *blocked*

- Attempted to open `http://localhost:3030` via `chrome-devtools__new_page`, but the MCP bridge responded with `Failed to fetch browser webSocket URL from http://localhost:9222/json/version`.
- Tried launching Chromium locally (`google-chrome`, `chromium`, `chromium-browser`) to provide a debugging endpoint; binaries are not available in this environment, so the DevTools session could not be established.
- Result: Manual QA via Chrome DevTools remains **blocked** pending access to a running MCP-compatible Chrome instance.
