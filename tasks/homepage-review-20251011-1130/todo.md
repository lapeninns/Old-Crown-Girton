# Implementation Checklist

## Discovery & Analysis
- [x] Create task directory and capture research context
- [x] Map server entry (`app/page.tsx`) and data loaders
- [x] Audit `ClientHomeContent` progressive sections and CSS hooks
- [x] Review each homepage section component for accessibility/design-system alignment
- [x] Inspect navigation/footer chrome for fixed positioning & focus implications

## Verification Prep
- [x] Gather scenarios for Chrome DevTools QA (breakpoints, reduced motion, performance)
- [x] Request Chrome DevTools MCP authentication token from user (if required)

## Manual QA
- [ ] Run DevTools console/performance/accessibility checks once token is supplied
- [ ] Capture observations from responsive emulation and reduced-motion testing

## Review Synthesis
- [ ] Summarize findings with file references and suggested follow-ups
- [ ] Document verification results in `verification.md`

## Questions/Blockers
- Chrome DevTools MCP endpoint (`http://localhost:9222`) unavailable in CLI harness, so manual QA remains blocked pending tooling access.
