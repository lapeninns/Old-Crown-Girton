# Plan — Home Slideshow Analysis

1. **Catalog Supporting Modules**  
   - Re-read `components/slideshow/Slideshow.tsx`, `Slide.tsx`, `SlideCTAButton.tsx`, `useImagePreloader.ts`, and `slideshow/slides.ts` to confirm control/data flow and note exact line references.  
   - Inspect adjacent systems (`hooks/useSeamlessLoading.tsx`, debugging utilities) for any additional behaviors affecting the slideshow.

2. **Map Architecture & Flow**  
   - Trace the execution path from `app/page.tsx` → `ClientHomeContent` → `Showcase` → `Slideshow`, documenting initialization, render flow, and dependencies.  
   - Detail how slides are sourced, filtered, randomized, and rendered during a typical session.

3. **Deep-Dive State & Interaction Logic**  
   - Enumerate all state variables, refs, and effects governing autoplay, transitions, preloading, and gesture handling.  
   - Stress-test mental models for edge behaviors (wrap-around, rapid interactions, failures) against the implementation.

4. **Assess Performance & Accessibility Hooks**  
   - Evaluate optimizations (preloading heuristics, reduced motion handling, fetch priorities) and cross-check with related hooks/providers.  
   - Identify accessibility features (ARIA, focus expectations) and any potential gaps.

5. **Compile Response Matrix**  
   - Answer each item in the user’s HTML/CSS/JS and React component question lists, explicitly noting the absence of a vanilla implementation.  
   - Highlight algorithms, patterns, dependencies, and uncertainties with supporting file:line references.

6. **Verification & Cross-Checks**  
   - Cross-verify conclusions using code inspection, repository search, and (if applicable) static reasoning (e.g., modulo arithmetic for CTA cycling).  
   - Document potential pitfalls or assumptions that remain and how they were mitigated.
