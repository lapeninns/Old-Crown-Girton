# Task Overview: Homepage Slideshow Update

## Initial Requirements

- Add two permanent slides to the homepage slideshow: a Christmas slide and a Curry & Carol slide.
- Source slide content from the existing Christmas and Curry & Carol pages.
- Include two calls-to-action on each new slide: one to call the restaurant and another that links to the menu.
- Reuse images located at the repository root, converting formats if needed for the slideshow.

## Success Criteria

- Homepage slideshow displays the Christmas and Curry & Carol slides consistently (not part of any rotation-specific subset).
- Each new slide features accurate copy and imagery derived from its corresponding page content.
- Slides include functioning CTA buttons: one tel: link and one menu navigation link.
- Images render correctly and meet performance/best-practice expectations for the slideshow component.
