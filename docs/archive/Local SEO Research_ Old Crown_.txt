Comprehensive Local SEO and Content Strategy for The Old Crown, Girton




1.0 Executive Summary




1.1 Overview of Strategic Imperatives


This report presents a comprehensive local Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and content marketing strategy for The Old Crown, located at 89 High St, Girton, Cambridge. The core strategic challenge facing the establishment is the need to consolidate a fractured online identity. Following several changes in management and culinary focus, The Old Crown currently possesses a powerful and unique selling proposition (USP)—the fusion of a traditional British pub with authentic Nepalese cuisine—that is not being fully leveraged in the digital sphere.1 The primary objective of this strategy is to unify the brand narrative, clearly communicating this dual identity to attract a diverse local customer base and establish The Old Crown as a prominent and beloved destination in the competitive Girton and greater Cambridge hospitality market.


1.2 Key Findings


The analysis reveals several critical findings that form the foundation of the recommended strategy:
* Competitive Advantage: The offering of an extensive Nepalese menu is a significant and currently under-leveraged differentiator.1 In a local market saturated with traditional pub grub and high-end gastropubs, this unique culinary focus provides a distinct competitive edge that can attract customers from across the Cambridge area.
* Audience Opportunity: The pub is ideally situated to serve at least four distinct and high-value local audience segments: Girton residents, the Cambridge University community (particularly from nearby Girton College), professionals from the region's thriving tech and biotech sectors, and tourists seeking authentic local experiences.3 Each of these groups has different needs and search behaviours that require tailored content and targeted messaging.
* Foundational Weakness: A history of reinventions and a period of closure have resulted in inconsistent and outdated information across the web.7 This digital legacy erodes consumer trust, creates a confusing brand identity, and negatively impacts search engine rankings. Correcting this is a foundational prerequisite for growth.


1.3 Summary of Recommendations


To address these findings and achieve the stated objectives, this report outlines a multi-faceted strategy. The following high-level recommendations are detailed within the subsequent sections:
1. Google Business Profile (GBP) Overhaul: A complete and continuous optimisation of the GBP listing to serve as the cornerstone of local search visibility. This includes selecting appropriate primary and secondary categories, crafting a compelling description, and actively using features like Posts, Q&A, and Menus.
2. Comprehensive Citation Management: Execution of a thorough audit and cleanup of all online business directories and listings to ensure absolute consistency of Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) and to remove outdated information from previous management eras.
3. Persona-Driven Website Content Hub: Development of a content-rich website that serves as a central hub of information, with dedicated pages and blog content tailored to the specific needs and search queries of each target audience persona.
4. Proactive Review Management: Implementation of a systematic strategy to encourage a steady stream of positive customer reviews on key platforms and to respond to all feedback promptly and professionally.
5. Targeted Social Media Engagement: A focused social media strategy that builds a local community, showcases the unique "Pub + Nepalese" identity through high-quality visuals, and engages directly with local groups and influencers.

2.0 Digital Presence Audit: The Old Crown Girton


This section establishes a baseline assessment of The Old Crown's current digital assets. It identifies foundational strengths to build upon and critical weaknesses that must be addressed before launching new content and marketing initiatives. The pub's complex history necessitates a thorough evaluation to ensure a clear and consistent brand message is presented to both potential customers and search engines.


2.1 Website Analysis (oldcrowngirton.com)


The official website serves as the central digital storefront for the business. Its performance, content, and user experience are critical factors in converting search traffic into customers.
* Technical SEO: A preliminary review indicates that the website is built on a template provided by the parent company, Lapen Inns, and appears to be mobile-friendly, which is a fundamental requirement for local search.1 However, a deeper technical audit is required to assess crucial ranking factors such as page load speed, the implementation of structured data (Schema Markup), and image optimisation. Schema Markup is particularly vital for a restaurant, as it allows search engines to understand and display specific information like menus, opening hours, and reviews directly in search results, significantly enhancing visibility. The use of a parent company template may impose structural limitations that could hinder bespoke SEO efforts.
* On-Page SEO & Content: The homepage effectively communicates the pub's dual offering: a traditional pub setting combined with Nepalese cuisine.1 The "About" page further supports this with a good summary of the pub's charm and its family-friendly and dog-friendly policies.11 The primary weakness lies in the lack of content depth. The "Read More" links for key features like "Live Sports" and "Takeaway" currently redirect to the same page, representing a significant missed opportunity.1 Dedicated, keyword-rich pages for these services would provide more value to users and create more assets for search engines to rank. Furthermore, while the website features positive customer reviews, they appear to be static images of testimonials from Google and Facebook rather than live, embedded reviews.11 This method prevents search engines from crawling the review text and understanding the sentiment, thereby diminishing their SEO value.
* Calls-to-Action (CTAs): The website demonstrates a strong understanding of conversion with a prominent and frequently repeated "Book Now" button, which effectively encourages users to make a reservation.1 However, the CTA for the takeaway service—"call for details"—is less effective.1 In an era of digital convenience, this creates friction for the user. A more effective approach would be to provide a direct link to an online menu, or ideally, an integrated online ordering system.


2.2 Google Business Profile (GBP) Assessment


For any local business, the Google Business Profile is arguably the single most important local SEO asset. It is often the first interaction a potential customer has with the business in search results and on Google Maps.
* Completeness & Accuracy: The essential business information—Name, Address, and Phone Number (NAP)—appears to be correct and consistent with the website.1 However, a comprehensive analysis is necessary to ensure that all available GBP fields and attributes are fully utilised. The primary business category is likely set to "Pub Restaurant" or a similar variant, but the addition of "Nepalese Restaurant" as a secondary category is critical for capturing search queries from users specifically seeking that cuisine.13 Attributes such as "outdoor seating," "dog-friendly," "live music," and "wheelchair accessible" must be accurately selected to appear in filtered searches.
* Visuals & Engagement: The quality, quantity, and recency of photos on the GBP listing are paramount. High-resolution, professionally shot, and geo-tagged images are needed to showcase the unique selling points: the authentic Nepalese dishes, the expansive garden and terrace, the historic thatched roof, and the atmosphere during live sports events. Active management features like GBP Posts (for promotions and events), the Q&A section (to proactively answer common questions), and the Menu feature (to display the full food and drink offering) must be consistently updated to signal to Google that the business is active and engaged.
* Reviews: The presence of positive Google reviews, which are repurposed on the website, indicates a favourable customer sentiment.11 However, the key ranking factors are the volume, velocity (the rate at which new reviews are acquired), and the owner's response rate to reviews directly on the GBP platform.14 A proactive strategy for generating new reviews and responding to all feedback is essential for building trust and improving local search rankings.


2.3 Local Citation & Brand Consistency Audit


A local citation is any online mention of a business's NAP information. Consistency across these citations is a cornerstone of local SEO, as it builds trust with search engines.
* NAP Consistency: The Old Crown is listed on several key directories, including Yell.com and the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) website.7 A critical, high-priority task is to conduct an exhaustive audit of these and dozens of other online directories to ensure that the Name, Address, and Phone number are 100% consistent everywhere.
* Historical Inconsistencies: The pub's recent history presents its most significant SEO liability. It has transitioned from a Greene King lease, to a high-end gastropub operated by Stuart Inns, to a period of closure, and now to its current incarnation as a pub with Nepalese cuisine under the Lapen Inns group.7 Each of these phases will have generated its own digital footprint of directory listings, press coverage, and customer reviews. There is a very high probability that outdated and conflicting information exists online. For instance, a potential customer might discover a glowing 2018 review praising the "Hereford sirloin steak" or "pork wellington" from the Stuart Inns era, dishes that are no longer available.17 This discrepancy creates a poor user experience, leading to confusion, disappointment, and a potential loss of business. For search engines, this profound inconsistency in core business information (especially cuisine type) across the web acts as a major negative ranking signal. It fundamentally undermines the business's perceived Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Therefore, a foundational cleanup of this digital legacy is not merely a recommendation; it is an absolute prerequisite for any future content strategy to succeed. This involves actively claiming and updating old profiles on review sites, correcting all directory listings, and creating a wave of new, consistent content that clearly and definitively establishes the pub's current identity.

3.0 The Competitive Landscape: Standing Out in Girton and Cambridge


A thorough analysis of the competitive environment is essential to define The Old Crown's strategic market position, identify opportunities for differentiation, and highlight its unique advantages. The pub competes not only with other establishments in its immediate vicinity but also within the broader, highly competitive Cambridge market.


3.1 Hyper-Local Competitor Analysis (Girton & Histon)


The most direct competition comes from pubs located within Girton and the neighbouring, larger village of Histon. These establishments define the local pub scene and set customer expectations.
* The George (Girton): Located just yards away on the same High Street, The George is the most direct competitor.16 It positions itself as a quintessential "local hub" for Girton, focusing on "traditional English Pub Grub" with a wide range of menus including lunch, dinner, Sunday roasts, and pizza.18 It broadens its appeal by operating as a café in the mornings and hosting community events like a beer festival.18 Some sources indicate it also houses a Thai takeaway, "Jeabs Thai," suggesting a potential dual-cuisine model similar to The Old Crown's, though this seems less central to its core identity.20 Its online presence is functional but basic, relying on a simple Weebly website, which may represent a digital marketing weakness.18 Reviews consistently praise its friendly, welcoming atmosphere and its peaceful, private beer garden.22
* The Boot (Histon): This establishment represents the premium, high-end of the local market. Described as an "award-winning local treasure," it is part of Raymond Blanc's prestigious White Brasserie Company.23 Its menu is a sophisticated blend of French brasserie cuisine and elevated British pub classics, with a price point estimated in the £50-£79 range, significantly higher than a typical pub.24 The Boot has a strong, professional online presence and garners exceptionally positive reviews that highlight its high-quality food (praising specific dishes like soufflés and cheese plates), beautiful "oak-beamed dining room," and excellent service.26 It is explicitly marketed as both dog-friendly and family-friendly.23
* The Red Lion (Histon): This pub carves out a niche focused on tradition, community, and real ale. As a past winner of a Cambridge CAMRA "Pub of the Year" award, it has strong credentials among beer enthusiasts.28 The food offering is classic British pub fare, including Sunday roasts, pies, and fish and chips.28 A key differentiator is its four en-suite bedrooms, allowing it to capture the pub-with-rooms market.28 It is also a hub for community events, hosting a well-regarded annual beer festival.31 Its online presence is professional, with reviews praising its community spirit, beer selection, and comfortable accommodation.31


3.2 Wider Cambridge Market Context


Beyond the immediate locale, The Old Crown competes for attention within the broader Cambridge pub scene. The most successful and well-known pubs in the city typically leverage a unique hook to attract both locals and the significant tourist population.
* History and Storytelling: Pubs like The Eagle have become major tourist destinations by heavily promoting their historical significance, such as its famous connection to the discovery of DNA and its role as a watering hole for WWII pilots.34
* Prime Location: Establishments situated in picturesque locations, particularly riverside pubs like The Mill and The Anchor, possess a powerful natural advantage that draws in customers seeking scenic views.34
* Specialist Offerings: Many pubs create a destination appeal by specialising. The Pint Shop is known for its extensive selection of craft beer and gin, while The Cambridge Blue is a mecca for real ale and foreign beer enthusiasts.34
* Atmosphere and Ambience: A recurring theme in positive reviews is the value placed on a "cosy," traditional pub atmosphere, often featuring open fires, "snug" areas, and a welcoming feel.35


3.3 Defining The Old Crown's Unique Selling Proposition (USP)


Based on the competitive analysis, The Old Crown's primary USP is the unexpected and compelling fusion of a traditional, historic English pub environment with an authentic, high-quality Nepalese culinary experience. This dual identity allows it to occupy a unique space in the market that no direct competitor currently fills. This core USP is supported by several other strong selling points:
* Distinctive Architecture: Its claim to be the "largest thatched pub in the country" provides a powerful, memorable, and historically significant hook that is highly attractive to tourists and locals alike.7
* Comprehensive Facilities: The pub offers a combination of features that cater to multiple audiences simultaneously: a large garden and terrace for families and summer dining, large-screen TVs for live sports fans, and a dog-friendly policy.1
* Authentic and Praised Cuisine: The Nepalese food is not merely a novelty; it is a core strength. Reviews consistently praise the dishes as "absolutely amazing," "so good," and a refreshing alternative to standard pub fare or more common Indian curries.2
The strategic challenge is not a lack of strengths, but a need to communicate them effectively. The Old Crown is effectively competing on two fronts: against traditional village pubs like The George for the "local pint and Sunday roast" crowd, and against city-centre ethnic restaurants for the "adventurous foodie" crowd. Its marketing and content must bridge this gap, presenting a unified message that it offers the best of both worlds. While The George is the primary competitor for the "traditional local" feel and The Boot competes for the "premium dining" customer, The Old Crown can carve out a highly desirable niche between these two poles: a relaxed, authentic pub experience with an exciting and superior food offering.

4.0 Understanding the Local Audience: Personas and Search Intent


To create content that resonates and drives traffic, it is essential to develop a deep understanding of the target customer segments. This section outlines four key audience personas for The Old Crown, detailing their characteristics, needs, and likely search behaviours. A "one-size-fits-all" marketing approach will fail to capture the full potential of this diverse customer base; a segmented strategy is required.


4.1 Persona 1: "The Girton Local" (Families & Established Residents)


* Demographics: This group represents the core community of Girton, a village of approximately 4,500 people in 1,600 households.39 The village has a slightly older demographic profile than the national average, with 27% of residents aged 65 or over, but also includes many families with children.3 They are engaged in village life, participating in local clubs, societies, and activities held at venues like the William Collyn Community Centre and St. Andrew's Church.41
* Psychographics & Needs: "The Girton Local" values community, familiarity, and convenience. They are looking for a reliable and friendly "local" pub for a casual weeknight pint, a family-friendly Sunday lunch, or a meal out that doesn't require travelling into central Cambridge. They are likely aware of The Old Crown's history of management changes and may need reassurance about its current stability and quality. Their decision-making is influenced by word-of-mouth and a sense of supporting local businesses.
* Content & Keywords: This persona will respond positively to content that reinforces The Old Crown's role as a community hub. This includes information about local history (the pub's thatched roof, the village's Roman origins), promotions for community events (such as Christmas gatherings 43), and clear communication of its family-friendly features (the large garden, a dedicated kids menu 2). Their search queries will be high-intent and hyper-local, using terms like:
pubs in Girton, Sunday lunch Girton, family friendly pub near me, pubs on Girton High Street, and The Old Crown Girton opening times.


4.2 Persona 2: "The Cambridge Student" (Girton College & Wider University)


   * Demographics: Girton is home to Girton College, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, making students a significant local population.39 The broader Cambridge student body is diverse, but a common characteristic is budget-consciousness.45 Student social life is a critical part of the university experience, often revolving around college bars, student societies, and exploring the city's pubs and restaurants.4
   * Psychographics & Needs: "The Cambridge Student" is digitally native, heavily relying on social media, Google Maps, and online reviews to make decisions. They are price-sensitive and actively seek out student discounts and value-for-money deals. They are looking for social spaces to gather in groups, venues for society events ("ents"), and casual dining options that offer something more exciting than college canteen food. They may be looking for venues slightly outside the crowded city centre for a more relaxed experience.
   * Content & Keywords: This audience will be attracted by content that highlights value, social opportunities, and unique experiences. This includes clear promotion of any student discounts, set menus, or special offers. Content showcasing the live sports broadcasts, the spacious garden for group gatherings, and the unique Nepalese food will be effective. Their search queries will often include modifiers related to value and specific needs: student deals Cambridge pubs, cheap eats Cambridge, pubs with live sport near Cambridge Uni, best pubs for students Cambridge, and pub quiz Girton.


4.3 Persona 3: "The Silicon Fen Professional" (Academics & Tech/Biotech Employees)


   * Demographics: Cambridge is a global hub for the technology and biotechnology industries, often referred to as "Silicon Fen".6 This has attracted a large and growing population of young, often affluent, professionals and academics. They live and work across the city and in surrounding villages, including affluent areas like Newnham and Trumpington, and are highly mobile.49
   * Psychographics & Needs: This persona is typically time-poor and places a high value on quality, unique experiences, and opportunities to unwind. They are sophisticated diners, open to diverse and authentic cuisines beyond standard pub fare.49 They are looking for high-quality options for various occasions: informal business lunches, after-work drinks with colleagues, and high-quality weekend meals with partners or friends.51
   * Content & Keywords: To attract this group, content must focus on the quality and authenticity of the Nepalese cuisine, the premium nature of the drinks selection (e.g., craft beers, extensive gin list), and the relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere of the refurbished pub. The large garden and terrace are strong selling points for this demographic. Their search queries will reflect a search for quality: best gastropubs Cambridge, business lunch spots Cambridge, restaurants near Cambridge Science Park, unique dining Cambridge, and best Nepalese food Cambridge.


4.4 Persona 4: "The Curious Tourist"


   * Demographics: Cambridge is a major tourist destination, attracting over 8 million visitors annually.53 While many are day-trippers from London and elsewhere, a significant number stay in the area to explore the city and its surroundings. This group is a mix of domestic and international visitors with varying budgets.
   * Psychographics & Needs: Tourists in Cambridge are primarily seeking experiences related to the city's history, culture, and unique character. When it comes to pubs, they often look for "authentic" English experiences: historic buildings, traditional ales, and a charming atmosphere.35 A pub with a distinct and memorable feature, such as being the "largest thatched pub in the country," is a powerful draw.7 They are also open to unique culinary experiences that offer a story.
   * Content & Keywords: Content for this persona must heavily feature the pub's history, its unique thatched architecture, and its convenient location just outside the main tourist centre. It should be positioned as a worthwhile and authentic destination. The combination of a historic building and unique Nepalese food is a compelling narrative. Their search queries are often discovery-oriented: historic pubs Cambridge, best country pubs near Cambridge, thatched roof pub Cambridge, pubs outside Cambridge city centre, and what to do in Girton Cambridge.
The existence of these four distinct personas, each with different motivations, demonstrates that a monolithic marketing message will be ineffective. A message focused solely on "Great Nepalese Food" might attract the Professional but could alienate the Local who is looking for a traditional pub. Conversely, a message of "Your Local Girton Pub" fails to capture the interest of the food-focused Professional or the experience-seeking Tourist. The content strategy must therefore be segmented, creating specific content streams and website pages tailored to each group. This could include a "Community & Events" page for Locals, a "Student Offers" section for Students, a "Corporate & Private Dining" page for Professionals, and a "History & Heritage" page for Tourists. This approach ensures that every potential customer finds information relevant to their specific needs, dramatically increasing the likelihood of engagement and conversion.

5.0 Strategic Keyword & Topic Analysis


This section identifies the specific search terms (keywords) and broader content themes that will form the backbone of The Old Crown's digital marketing efforts. The goal is to align the pub's online content with the precise language its target audiences are using when searching for dining and socialising options in and around Cambridge.


5.1 Core Keyword Cluster Analysis


A foundational keyword list has been developed by analysing core business offerings and applying local modifiers. This process identifies the primary terms that must be targeted across the website and Google Business Profile to capture relevant search traffic.55
   * "Pub" & "Restaurant" Keywords (Local Intent): These are broad, high-volume terms that capture users looking for general hospitality options in the immediate area.
   * High Priority: pubs in Girton, restaurants in Girton, The Old Crown Girton, pubs near Cambridge CB3, country pubs Cambridge.
   * Medium Priority: best pubs Cambridge, gastropubs Cambridge, pubs with beer garden Cambridge, thatched pub Cambridge.
   * "Nepalese Cuisine" Keywords (Niche Intent): These keywords target users with a specific culinary interest. Ranking for these terms establishes The Old Crown as a destination for a unique food experience.
   * High Priority: Nepalese food Cambridge, Nepalese restaurant Cambridge, momo dumplings Cambridge, best curry Cambridge.
   * Medium Priority: Himalayan food Cambridge, Gurkha restaurant Cambridge, authentic Nepalese food UK.
   * Feature-Based Keywords (Transactional Intent): These long-tail keywords are often used by searchers who are close to making a decision and are looking for a venue that meets specific criteria.
   * High Priority: Sunday roast Girton, Sunday lunch Cambridge, dog friendly pubs Cambridge, pubs showing football Cambridge, pub with live sport Cambridge.
   * Medium Priority: pub quiz Cambridge, pubs with parking Cambridge, family friendly restaurant Girton.


5.2 Question-Based & Conversational Query Analysis


The rise of voice search and more sophisticated search engine algorithms means that users are increasingly searching with full questions and conversational phrases. Understanding these queries is essential for creating content that directly answers user needs and for optimising for voice assistants.58 Tools like AnswerThePublic can reveal these patterns.61
   * Example Questions: Content should be structured to directly answer questions that potential customers are asking.
   * Who: "Who has the best Sunday roast in Girton?"
   * What: "What are the best dog-friendly pubs near Cambridge?"
   * Where: "Where can I watch the rugby in Cambridge?"
   * Which: "Which pubs in Girton have a garden?"
   * How: "How to get to Girton from Cambridge city centre?"
   * Example Prepositional & Comparison Queries: These reveal the context of a user's search and are valuable for creating highly specific content.
   * pubs in Cambridge *for* families
   * restaurants near Girton *with* parking
   * Nepalese food *vs* Indian food
   * The Old Crown *or* The George Girton


5.3 Content Gap Analysis


By analysing the digital presence of key local competitors (The George, The Boot, The Red Lion), it is possible to identify content areas that are underserved. These gaps represent strategic opportunities for The Old Crown to establish itself as the authority on specific topics.
   * Identified Gaps:
   * Unique Cuisine: The most significant gap is the lack of a strong, authentic ethnic food offering among direct competitors. While The George may have a Thai takeaway, it is not its primary identity. The Old Crown can and should own the narrative around unique, high-quality, non-traditional pub food in the area.
   * Specific Amenities: While competitors have outdoor spaces, none explicitly market a "large terrace overlooking gardens".1 This specific phrasing can be used to create a more appealing and distinct image than a generic "beer garden."
   * Historical Narrative: No competitor can claim the unique architectural and historical hook of being the "largest thatched pub in the country".7 This is a powerful, non-replicable content angle that should be heavily promoted.
The most valuable search terms for The Old Crown are not the highly competitive, single-intent keywords like "pubs in Cambridge." Instead, the greatest opportunity lies in targeting long-tail, multi-intent keywords that combine the pub's unique attributes. A search for "pubs in Girton" will be competitive. However, a search for a "dog-friendly pub with authentic curry near Cambridge" is a high-value niche query for which The Old Crown is the perfect answer. The content strategy must therefore focus on creating content that addresses these combined needs. A blog post titled, "Your Guide to a Perfect Dog-Friendly Day Out in Girton (Featuring Cambridge's Best Nepalese Lunch)" is far more powerful and likely to rank for valuable, specific searches than a generic menu page.

6.0 The Blueprint for Local Dominance: A Content and SEO Strategy


This section provides a detailed, actionable roadmap for implementing the findings of the preceding analysis. The strategy is divided into four key pillars: foundational optimisation, website content development, a persona-driven content calendar, and community engagement.


6.1 Foundational SEO & Google Business Profile Optimisation


Before creating new content, it is imperative to establish a strong and accurate digital foundation. This ensures that when users find The Old Crown, the information is correct, trustworthy, and compelling.
   * Google Business Profile (GBP) Overhaul:
   * Categories: The primary category should be set to "Pub" or "Pub Restaurant" to capture the broadest local pub searches. Crucially, "Nepalese Restaurant" must be added as a secondary category to appear in specific cuisine-related searches.15
   * Description: A new, professionally written business description is required. It must lead with the pub's core identity ("Experience Girton's historic Old Crown, the country's largest thatched pub...") and immediately introduce the USP ("...home to Cambridge's most authentic Nepalese cuisine."). It should also include keywords related to the garden, live sports, and its dog-friendly nature.10
   * Visuals: A professional photoshoot should be commissioned to generate a minimum of 20-30 high-quality, geo-tagged images. These must cover all categories: exterior (highlighting the thatch), interior (showing the modern, relaxed surroundings), food (vibrant shots of Nepalese dishes), the garden/terrace, and atmosphere (patrons enjoying a meal or watching sports).
   * Features: The GBP Menu feature must be fully built out with the complete Nepalese menu, including descriptions, prices, and photos for key dishes. A schedule should be created to publish GBP Posts at least twice per week, promoting weekend specials, upcoming sports fixtures, events, and new blog content. The Q&A section should be proactively populated by asking and answering common questions identified during keyword research (e.g., "Do you have parking?", "Is the garden child-friendly?").
   * Citation Management:
   * Audit and Cleanup: A comprehensive citation audit must be performed using a service like BrightLocal or Moz Local to identify all online mentions of the business.15
   * Correction: All inconsistent or outdated listings must be manually claimed and corrected. This is a critical step to resolve the brand confusion caused by previous ownerships. Priority should be given to high-authority directories like Yell, TripAdvisor, CAMRA, and local Cambridge-specific sites.7 The goal is 100% NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across the web.


6.2 Website Content Hub Development


The website must be transformed from a simple brochure into a rich content hub that serves the needs of all target personas and ranks for a wide range of keywords.
   * Homepage: The homepage copy should be refined to immediately and powerfully communicate the "Historic Pub, Himalayan Flavours" USP.
   * Menu Pages: The current menu offering needs to be expanded into separate, detailed landing pages for the Nepalese Food Menu, the Sunday Roast Menu, and the Drinks Menu (including real ales and the gin selection). These menus must be created as HTML text for search engines to crawl effectively; PDF menus should be avoided as primary content. Each page should be enhanced with high-quality photography.
   * Dedicated Feature Pages: To capture specific, high-intent searches, the following dedicated pages must be created:
   * Live Sports at The Old Crown: This page should feature a dynamic, updatable schedule of upcoming televised games (football, rugby, etc.) and be optimised for keywords like pubs showing football Cambridge.
   * Our Dog-Friendly Pub & Garden: A page detailing the pub's policy for dogs, including photos of dogs in the garden, to rank for dog friendly pubs Cambridge.
   * The History of The Old Crown: A detailed page telling the story of the pub, leveraging the "largest thatched pub" angle to attract tourists and history enthusiasts.
   * Private Hire & Events: A page targeted at corporate clients and student societies, outlining options for private parties, meetings, and social events.
   * Blog/News Section: A blog is the engine of the content strategy. It will house the persona-driven articles designed to attract organic traffic and build authority.


6.3 Persona-Driven Content Calendar (First 3 Months)


The following content calendar provides a starting point for populating the blog and social media channels, with each piece of content targeting a specific persona.
   * Month 1 (Foundation & Local Focus):
   * Blog Post 1 (For Locals & Tourists): "A Look Inside Girton's Oldest Pub: The Story of The Old Crown's Thatched Roof." This piece establishes historical authority and targets keywords related to the pub's unique architecture.
   * Blog Post 2 (For Professionals & Foodies): "Not Just Another Curry: What Makes Our Nepalese Cuisine the Most Authentic in Cambridge?" This article can feature an interview with the chef, explain the nuances of Nepalese flavours versus Indian, and highlight signature dishes like momo.
   * Social Campaign: A "Meet the Team" series on Facebook and Instagram, introducing the bar and kitchen staff to build a personal connection with the local community.
   * Month 2 (University & Features Focus):

6.4 Community Engagement & Review Generation Strategy


Content creation must be supported by active community management and a proactive approach to building social proof.
   * Social Media: The pub's Facebook and Instagram profiles should be actively managed with daily posts featuring high-quality photos of food, the pub's interior and garden, and patrons enjoying themselves. Targeted advertising campaigns should be used to promote key blog posts and offers to specific demographic and interest groups within the Cambridge area.
   * Review Generation: A systematic process for encouraging reviews must be implemented. This can include placing small, well-designed cards or QR codes on tables and menus that link directly to the Google Business Profile review page. Staff should be trained to politely ask satisfied customers if they would consider leaving a review.
   * Review Response: It is imperative to respond to every new review on Google within 24 hours.10 Positive reviews should receive a personalised thank you. Negative reviews should receive a polite, professional, and non-defensive response that addresses the issue and offers a resolution. This active management demonstrates excellent customer service and helps to control the narrative around the pub's past inconsistencies.

7.0 Conclusion and Strategic Roadmap




7.1 Summary of Strategic Direction


The Old Crown Girton is at a pivotal moment. It possesses a unique and powerful combination of assets: a historic, charming building, excellent facilities, and a distinctive, high-quality culinary offering that sets it apart from any local competitor. However, its potential is currently constrained by a fractured digital identity stemming from its recent history.
The path to local market dominance lies in a clear, confident, and consistent communication of its dual identity as "Girton's Historic Thatched Pub with Cambridge's Best Himalayan Flavours." By executing a meticulous cleanup of its existing digital footprint, building a strong foundation on Google Business Profile, and rolling out a strategic, persona-driven content plan, The Old Crown can resolve past brand confusion. This strategy will allow it to simultaneously appeal to the local community seeking a traditional pub experience and attract discerning diners, students, and tourists from across the wider Cambridge area who are in search of something unique and memorable.


7.2 Prioritised 12-Month Roadmap


The implementation of this strategy should be phased to ensure foundational issues are resolved before scaling content and outreach efforts.
   * Phase 1 (Months 1-3 - Foundational Fixes & Content Launch):
   * Priority 1: Complete the full Google Business Profile overhaul, including new categories, description, and professional photography.
   * Priority 2: Conduct the comprehensive citation audit and begin the process of correcting all inconsistent and outdated online listings.
   * Priority 3: Launch the new, dedicated feature pages on the website (Live Sports, Dog-Friendly, History, Private Hire).
   * Priority 4: Execute the first three months of the content calendar, establishing a regular rhythm of blog and social media posting.
   * Goal: To establish a consistent and accurate digital presence and begin targeting core keywords.
   * Phase 2 (Months 4-6 - Content Acceleration & Proactive Engagement):
   * Priority 1: Ramp up blog production to two posts per week, covering a wider range of persona-driven topics.
   * Priority 2: Launch the proactive review generation campaign using in-venue materials (QR codes, etc.).
   * Priority 3: Begin targeted outreach to local Cambridge food bloggers, student societies, and local community groups to build relationships and generate third-party content.
   * Goal: To increase the volume and velocity of content and social proof, and to begin building authority and backlinks.
   * Phase 3 (Months 7-12 - Authority Building & Strategic Expansion):
   * Priority 1: Analyse traffic and engagement data from the first six months to identify top-performing content. Refine the keyword strategy based on these results.
   * Priority 2: Explore video content creation, such as a short tour of the historic pub, interviews with the chef about Nepalese cuisine, or clips of the atmosphere during a major sports match.
   * Priority 3: Plan and promote a major on-site event, such as a "Nepalese Food & Ale Festival," to generate significant local press and social media buzz.
   * Goal: To solidify The Old Crown's position as a local authority, expand into new content formats, and drive significant footfall through major marketing initiatives.
