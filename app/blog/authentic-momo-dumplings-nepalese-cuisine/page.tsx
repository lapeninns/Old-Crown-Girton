    excerpt: "Discover the art of authentic Nepalese momo dumplings and explore the rich flavors of Himalayan cuisine at Cambridge's most unique restaurant destination.",
    content: `
      <p>In the heart of Girton village, inside England's largest thatched pub, something extraordinary is happening. The ancient art of Nepalese cooking is being preserved and celebrated, bringing the authentic flavors of the Himalayas to Cambridge. At the center of this culinary journey are our signature momo dumplings - a dish that represents centuries of tradition and the soul of Nepalese cuisine.</p>
      
      <h2>What Are Momo Dumplings?</h2>
      <p>Momos are traditional Nepalese dumplings that originated in Tibet and have become Nepal's most beloved comfort food. These delicate parcels consist of thin dough wrapped around carefully seasoned fillings, then steamed to perfection. Our momo dumplings at Old Crown Girton are handmade using recipes passed down through generations, ensuring every bite delivers authentic Himalayan flavors.</p>
      
      <p>Unlike Chinese dumplings or other Asian alternatives, Nepalese momos have their own distinct character. The dough is rolled thinner, the seasoning blend includes unique Himalayan spices, and the folding technique creates distinctive pleated patterns that aren't just beautiful - they help the momos cook evenly and hold the perfect amount of flavorful filling.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Authentic Momo Making Process</h2>
      <p>Every morning, our kitchen team begins the meticulous process of creating fresh momos. The dough is mixed from scratch using just flour, water, and a pinch of salt - simplicity that allows the filling flavors to shine. Each piece is hand-rolled to achieve the perfect thickness, then carefully filled with our signature mixtures.</p>
      
      <p>Our vegetable momos feature a aromatic blend of cabbage, carrots, onions, ginger, garlic, and traditional Nepalese spices including cumin, coriander, and fenugreek. The chicken momos use fresh, locally-sourced chicken mince combined with the same vegetable base, creating a satisfying and well-balanced filling that's neither too heavy nor too light.</p>
      
      <h2>The Art of Momo Folding</h2>
      <p>Perhaps the most skilled aspect of momo preparation is the folding technique. Our experienced chefs create 16-18 pleats around each dumpling, a process that requires years to master. This isn't just for aesthetics - the pleating technique ensures the momos maintain their shape during steaming and creates the perfect texture contrast between the soft, yielding exterior and the flavorful interior.</p>
      
      <p>Watching our team fold momos is mesmerizing - their hands move with practiced precision, creating perfect dumplings at remarkable speed. Each momo is a small work of art, consistent in size and shape, ensuring even cooking and an attractive presentation that honors the tradition behind the dish.</p>
      
      <h2>Beyond Momos: Exploring Our Nepalese Menu</h2>
      <p>While momos are our signature, they're just the beginning of your Nepalese culinary journey at Old Crown Girton. Our dal bhat - the national dish of Nepal - offers a complete, nutritious meal featuring lentil curry (dal) served with rice (bhat), along with seasonal vegetables, pickles, and your choice of curry.</p>
      
      <p>Our curry selection showcases the diversity of Nepalese cuisine, which draws influences from Indian, Tibetan, and Chinese cooking traditions while maintaining its own distinct character. Our chefs use authentic spice blends imported directly from Nepal, ensuring flavors that transport you to the markets of Kathmandu.</p>
      
      <h2>What Makes Nepalese Cuisine Unique</h2>
      <p>Many people assume Nepalese food is similar to Indian cuisine, but the reality is far more nuanced. While both use similar base spices, Nepalese cooking tends to be less heavily spiced and more focused on highlighting the natural flavors of ingredients. The influence of Tibetan cuisine introduces elements like steaming techniques and the use of yak-derived seasonings (adapted for local ingredients).</p>
      
      <p>Nepalese cuisine also emphasizes balance - not just in flavors, but in nutrition and texture. A traditional Nepalese meal includes grains, legumes, vegetables, and often meat, creating a complete nutritional profile that sustained mountain communities for centuries.</p>
      
      <h2>The Cambridge Connection</h2>
      <p>Cambridge's diverse, educated population has embraced our authentic Nepalese offering with enthusiasm. Students discover flavors they've never experienced, while food enthusiasts appreciate the opportunity to explore a cuisine that's often overshadowed by its more familiar neighbors.</p>
      
      <p>Our location in a traditional English pub creates an unexpected but delightful contrast - the familiar comfort of a village pub setting combined with the exotic excitement of discovering authentic Himalayan flavors. It's this combination that makes Old Crown Girton truly unique in the Cambridge dining scene.</p>
      
      <h2>Pairing Nepalese Food with English Pub Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>One might think Nepalese cuisine and English pub culture would clash, but the opposite is true. Both traditions emphasize community, sharing, and taking time to enjoy good food with good company. Our spacious beer garden provides the perfect setting for enjoying momos with friends, while our selection of real ales and wines complement the aromatic spices beautifully.</p>
      
      <p>Many customers discover that our Nepalese dishes pair wonderfully with traditional English beverages. The clean, crisp flavors of a well-kept bitter provide an excellent counterpoint to our mildly spiced curries, while our house wines are selected specifically to complement both our Nepalese and traditional British offerings.</p>
      
      <h2>Your First Momo Experience</h2>
      <p>For newcomers to Nepalese cuisine, we recommend starting with our mixed momo plate, which allows you to try both vegetable and chicken varieties. Each order comes with our homemade chutney - a spicy, tangy accompaniment that perfectly complements the dumplings.</p>
      
      <p>Don't be surprised if you find yourself planning your next visit before you've finished your first plate. There's something addictive about authentic momos that keeps people coming back, and we're proud to have introduced countless Cambridge residents to what might become their new favorite comfort food.</p>
