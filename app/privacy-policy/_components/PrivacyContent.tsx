      <p>We retain data only as long as needed for the purposes stated or to meet legal/accounting requirements. Generic enquiry emails are typically retained for <span>12 months</span>. Booking records (for accounting / safety) may be stored up to 7 years per UK HMRC guidance. You may request deletion (see Your Rights) unless we must retain for legitimate reasons.</p>
      
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">7. Security</h2>
