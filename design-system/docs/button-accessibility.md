# Button Accessibility Audit

This document records automated contrast checks and accessibility recommendations for the button component variants.

Summary:
- Tokens source: `theme/colors.js` and runtime CSS variables injected into `:root`.
- Button tokens: `design-system/tokens/button-tokens.json`.
- Button CSS: `design-system/css/button.css`.

Checks performed:
- Contrast checks for foreground/background for primary, secondary, accent and destructive variants in both light and dark theme contexts.
- Keyboard focus: focus ring token presence recommended (CSS uses `box-shadow` ring on `.ds-button:focus`).
- Disabled state: buttons with `[disabled]` or `.ds-button--disabled` have pointer-events removed and opacity reduced.

Recommendations:
1. Ensure `--color-primary` and `--color-primaryAccent` meet 4.5:1 contrast against `#ffffff` where used as foreground in primary buttons.
2. Add `aria-busy` handling for loading buttons and ensure icon-only buttons receive an `aria-label`.
3. In code use semantic `<button>` for actions; prefer anchors only for navigation.
4. Consider switching focus ring color to a high-contrast semantic token (e.g., `--color-accent-600`) for sufficient visibility in all themes.
