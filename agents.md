> **Instructions for AI coding agents working on this project**

---

## Project Overview

This project follows a systematic **Context Engineering Framework** for all development work. Before writing any code, you must follow the structured workflow phases to ensure quality, consistency, and maintainability.

---

## Core Workflow: Task-Based Development

### Task Structure

Every feature, bug fix, or enhancement is treated as a discrete task with its own timestamped directory:

```
tasks/<task-id>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM/
├── research.md      # Findings, patterns, and resources
├── plan.md          # Implementation strategy and requirements
├── todo.md          # Executable checklist
└── verification.md  # Test scenarios and validation criteria
```

**Task ID naming**: Use semantic slug + timestamp (e.g., `user-authentication-flow-20250110-1430`, `payment-gateway-integration-20250110-0915`)

**Timestamp format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM` (Year Month Day - Hour Minute in 24-hour format)

---

## Mandatory Workflow Phases

You **MUST** follow these phases in order. Do not skip phases or write code prematurely.

### Phase 0: Task Setup

**Before anything else:**

1. Create task directory with timestamp: `tasks/<semantic-task-id>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM/`
   - Example: `tasks/user-auth-flow-20250110-1430/`
2. Document initial requirements
3. Identify success criteria

**Timestamp format**: Use `YYYYMMDD-HHMM` format (e.g., `20250110-1430` for January 10, 2025 at 2:30 PM)

### Phase 1: Research (`research.md`)

**Goal**: Build comprehensive understanding before planning or coding.

**Required activities:**

- Search codebase for existing patterns, components, and utilities
- Identify reusable code and established conventions
- Note technical debt or anti-patterns to avoid
- Review external documentation, RFCs, or specifications (if applicable)
- Document all findings, constraints, and recommendations

**Output**: `research.md` containing:

- Existing patterns discovered
- Relevant external resources
- Technical constraints or dependencies
- Open questions and answers
- Recommended approach with rationale

**Example structure**:

```markdown
# Research: <Feature Name>

## Existing Patterns

- Component X handles similar logic
- API pattern Y is used consistently

## External Resources

- [Documentation](url)
- Best practices from [source](url)

## Technical Constraints

- Must support React 18 concurrent features
- Performance budget: <200ms initial render

## Recommendations

Recommend approach Z because...
```

### Phase 2: Planning (`plan.md`)

**Goal**: Create comprehensive, implementable blueprint.

**Required activities:**

- Review `research.md` thoroughly
- Design solution using existing patterns
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Plan for edge cases and error states
- Validate scope with stakeholder if needed

**Output**: `plan.md` containing:

- **Objective**: Problem statement and success criteria
- **Architecture**: High-level design decisions
- **Component breakdown**: What needs to be built/modified
- **Data flow**: How information moves through system
- **API contracts**: Request/response formats
- **UI/UX considerations**: User flows, states, interactions
- **Testing strategy**: How to validate correctness
- **Edge cases**: Error states, empty states, loading states
- **Rollout plan**: Deployment strategy

**Example structure**:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: <Feature Name>

## Objective

Enable users to [goal] by [approach]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can complete [action] in <3 clicks
- [ ] Page loads in <1s on 3G
- [ ] Passes accessibility checks

## Architecture

### Components

- `<FeatureContainer>`: Main orchestrator
- `<FeatureForm>`: User input handling

### State Management

Use React Context for [reason]

### API Integration

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/feature`
**Request**: `{ param: string }`
**Response**: `{ data: Object[] }`

## Implementation Steps

1. Create base component structure
2. Implement API integration
3. Add form validation
4. Build results display
5. Add accessibility features
6. Write tests

## Edge Cases

- Empty state: Show onboarding
- Error state: Provide recovery options
- Loading state: Show skeleton

## Testing

- Unit: Component logic
- Integration: API calls
- E2E: User journeys
- Accessibility: Keyboard nav

## Rollout

- Feature flag: `enable_new_feature`
- Gradual: 10% → 50% → 100%
```

### Phase 3: Implementation (`todo.md`)

**Goal**: Execute plan systematically.

**Process:**

1. Create `todo.md` breaking plan into atomic tasks
2. Work through checklist sequentially
3. Check off completed items
4. Document deviations from plan
5. **Batch questions** until end of implementation
6. Make reasonable assumptions (document them)

**Guidelines:**

- ✅ Work as long as possible without interruption
- ✅ Prioritize working code over perfect code
- ✅ Refactor after core functionality works
- ❌ Don't stop for every small question
- ❌ Don't interrupt momentum for clarifications

**Output**: `todo.md` with checklist:

```markdown
# Implementation Checklist

## Setup

- [x] Create component files
- [ ] Configure feature flag

## Core Functionality

- [x] Implement data fetching
- [ ] Add validation logic

## UI/UX

- [ ] Build responsive layout
- [ ] Add loading states

## Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Manual QA pass

## Questions/Blockers

- How should we handle [edge case]?
```

### Phase 4: Verification (`verification.md`)

**Goal**: Ensure implementation meets requirements and quality standards.

**⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: **MUST** perform manual QA using Chrome DevTools (MCP) tool for all UI/frontend work. This is not optional.

**Required activities:**

- **MUST** use Chrome DevTools MCP tool to inspect and test the implementation
- Test all user flows
- Verify edge cases
- Confirm error handling
- Performance profiling (using DevTools Performance tab)
- Accessibility audit (using DevTools Lighthouse/Accessibility panel)
- Cross-browser/device testing (using DevTools Device Emulation)
- Console error/warning checks

**Chrome DevTools MCP Tool Usage:**

- Inspect DOM structure and verify semantic HTML
- Test responsive layouts using Device Toolbar
- Check Console for errors and warnings
- Profile performance with Performance and Network tabs
- Validate accessibility with Lighthouse
- Test touch targets and interactive elements
- Verify focus management and keyboard navigation
- Check for layout shifts and rendering issues

**Output**: `verification.md` containing:

```markdown

## Framework & Component Requirements

### UI Components

- **MUST** use DaisyUI components when available
- **MUST** extend DaisyUI rather than build from scratch
- **MUST** follow established component patterns in codebase
- Search codebase first before creating new components

### Development Approach

- **Mobile First**: Design and build for mobile, then enhance for desktop
- **Test Driven**: Write tests alongside (or before) implementation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works everywhere

### Code Quality Principles

- **DRY**: Reuse existing code and patterns
- **KISS**: Simple solutions over clever ones
- **YAGNI**: Build what's needed, not what might be needed

---

## UI/UX Excellence Standards

### Keyboard & Focus

- **MUST** support full keyboard navigation per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
- **MUST** show visible focus rings using `:focus-visible`
- **MUST** manage focus correctly: trap in modals, move logically, return on close

### Touch Targets

- **MUST** have hit targets ≥24px (mobile ≥44px)
- If visual element <24px, expand hit area with padding/pseudo-elements
- **MUST** use `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom

### Forms & Input

- **MUST** use mobile `<input>` font-size ≥16px to prevent zoom, OR set proper viewport meta
- **NEVER** disable browser zoom
- **NEVER** block paste in inputs
- **MUST** make inputs hydration-safe (no lost focus/values)
- **MUST** show spinner on loading buttons while keeping label visible
- **MUST** make Enter submit focused text input
  - In `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits; Enter adds newline
- **MUST** keep submit button enabled until request starts
- **MUST** allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation errors
- **MUST** show errors inline next to fields (focus first error on submit)
- **MUST** use proper `autocomplete` attributes and meaningful `name` values
- **MUST** use correct `type` and `inputmode` for each field
- **MUST** warn users before navigating away with unsaved changes
- **MUST** trim input values

### State & Navigation

- **MUST** reflect state in URL (deep-link filters, tabs, pagination)
- **MUST** restore scroll position on back/forward navigation
- **MUST** use `<a>` or `<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)

### Feedback

- **SHOULD** use optimistic UI updates (reconcile on response)
- **MUST** confirm destructive actions OR provide Undo window
- **MUST** use polite `aria-live` regions for toasts and validation

### Animation

- **MUST** honor `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **MUST** animate only compositor-friendly properties (`transform`, `opacity`)
- **MUST** make animations interruptible and input-driven

### Layout

- **MUST** verify rendering on mobile, laptop, and ultra-wide screens
- **MUST** respect safe areas using `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- **MUST** avoid unwanted scrollbars

### Content & Accessibility

- **MUST** set `<title>` to match current context
- **MUST** design all states: empty, sparse, dense, error, loading
- **MUST** provide redundant status cues (not color-only)
- **MUST** ensure icons have text labels or `aria-label`
- **MUST** use hierarchical heading structure
- **MUST** provide accurate accessible names
- **MUST** prefer native semantic HTML before ARIA
- **MUST** use non-breaking spaces: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`
- **MUST** use ellipsis character `…` (not three periods)

### Performance

- **MUST** track and minimize re-renders
- **MUST** profile with CPU and network throttling
- **MUST** target <500ms for mutations
- **MUST** virtualize large lists
- **MUST** prevent Cumulative Layout Shift from images

## Nested AGENTS.md Files

### When to Create Nested Files

For **large monorepos** or projects with distinct subprojects/packages, create nested `AGENTS.md` files inside each subproject directory.

### Nested File Rules

1. **Automatic precedence**: Agents automatically read the nearest `AGENTS.md` in the directory tree
2. **Closest wins**: The closest file takes precedence for that subproject
3. **Tailored instructions**: Each subproject can ship specific guidelines

### Creating Nested Files

**Main AGENTS.md creates nested files when:**

- A subproject has unique build/test commands
- Different code style or testing requirements exist
- Subproject uses different frameworks or patterns
- Security or deployment differs from main project

**Nested AGENTS.md structure:**

```
/
├── AGENTS.md (main, you are reading this)
├── packages/
│   ├── web-app/
│   │   ├── AGENTS.md (web-specific instructions)
│   │   └── src/
│   ├── api-server/
│   │   ├── AGENTS.md (API-specific instructions)
│   │   └── src/
│   └── shared-ui/
│       ├── AGENTS.md (UI component library instructions)
│       └── components/
```

**Nested AGENTS.md template:**

```markdown
# AGENTS.md - [Subproject Name]

> Inherits from main AGENTS.md with these additions/overrides

## Subproject Overview

[Brief description]

## Build Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run test` - Run tests

## Subproject-Specific Guidelines

[Any unique patterns, conventions, or requirements]

## Additional Context

[Links to relevant documentation]
```

### Example: Large Monorepo

```
my-monorepo/
├── AGENTS.md                          # Main project guidelines
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   │   └── AGENTS.md                  # Next.js web app specifics
│   ├── mobile/
│   │   └── AGENTS.md                  # React Native specifics
│   └── admin/
│       └── AGENTS.md                  # Admin dashboard specifics
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   └── AGENTS.md                  # Design system guidelines
│   ├── api-client/
│   │   └── AGENTS.md                  # API client patterns
│   └── shared/
│       └── AGENTS.md                  # Shared utilities
└── infrastructure/
    └── AGENTS.md                      # Deployment & infrastructure
```

## MCP Server Integration

**MUST** always utilize MCP (Model Context Protocol) server whenever possible for:

- Enhanced context retrieval
- Codebase navigation
- Pattern discovery
- Documentation access
- **Chrome DevTools integration for manual QA (MANDATORY in verification phase)**

### Chrome DevTools MCP Authentication

**Note**: Chrome DevTools MCP may require authentication if the platform being tested requires sign-in.

- If the platform requires authentication, ask the user for a magic link token
- Magic link tokens are used for sign-in, not for MCP access
- Only request authentication when testing protected routes or features

**Usage pattern when authentication is needed:**

1. Before testing protected features, request: "Please provide a magic link token to sign in to the platform"
2. Wait for user to provide token
3. Complete sign-in process, then proceed with DevTools inspection

---

## Red Flags & Warnings

Stop and address these immediately:

- ⚠️ **No existing pattern found** → May need architecture discussion
- ⚠️ **Unclear requirements** → Stop and clarify before proceeding
- ⚠️ **Large scope** → Consider breaking into smaller tasks
- ⚠️ **Many assumptions** → Document and validate with stakeholder
- ⚠️ **No verification plan** → Define success criteria first
- ⚠️ **Skipped DevTools QA** → NEVER skip manual QA with Chrome DevTools MCP tool
